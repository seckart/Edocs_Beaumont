  <li>
  <p><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of an educational activity provided by the  organization focused on improving nurses&rsquo; expertise in teaching a patient or  family.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Education Need  Identified&nbsp;</strong> <br>
  Clinical nurses on 2  South are charged with the difficult task of caring for and guiding Hospice  patients and their family members through the end of life process. In November  2015, Edward Neumaier, BSN, RN, CHPN, Palliative Care Coordinator, brought to  the attention of Assistant Nurse Managers Kimberly Little, BSN, RN and Pam  Lively, BSN, RN that new clinical nurses (Sarah Boone, BSN, RN; Jessica Safron,  RN; and Kristin Suchoski RN) were having difficulty with teaching patients and  their families about managing symptoms during end of life care. In addition,  Donna Martin, RN, Beaumont Hospice Nurse, following discussions with family  members, approached Little and Lively with her concerns about 2 South clinical  nurses being able to provide the family of the dying patient with education  about untoward symptoms at end of life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further investigation by  Martin showed that a family was not familiar with signs of pain and how to know  when their loved one was in pain or anxious. Having the family educated on this  helps them feel involved with the care and provides the nurse with information  so they can help keep the patient comfortable. However, family members were not  familiar with the different types of breathing patterns that can be expected  during end of life, such as cheyne-stokes respirations, agonal breathing and  terminal congestions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family members knowing  this information would decrease their fear and anxiety because they would know  what to expect. They were uneasy seeing their loved one not eating or drinking,  as they felt the patient was starving to death. They did not understand that  their loved one&rsquo;s organs were failing and that their body would not tolerate  the food and fluid. Rather than reinforcing education that had already been  given, Martin found herself providing family members with the initial education  on what to watch for to assist the nurses with controlling symptoms for the end  of life care.&nbsp;This showed that 2 South clinical nurses were not provided  training on the management of symptoms at the end of life, which in turn made  it difficult for them to educate the family on the end of life process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the October/November  2015 meeting of the Oncology Center of Excellence (COE), a multidisciplinary  team, Little and Lively spoke about the need for hospice education for the 2  South clinical nurses. This education would need to include symptom management  for anxiety/agitation, delirium, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, secretions,  nausea/vomiting and pain that can occur at end of life. Sharon Solomon, MPA,  BSN, RN, Director of Beaumont Hospice, stated that all their Hospice nurses  went through education sessions provided by the Nurse Educator from Beaumont  Home Services, Richard McKenzie, BSN, RN, and completed annual hospice  education modules. These modules reviewed the management of untoward symptoms  and the importance of effectively teaching patients and family members what to  expect in end of life care. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE6-1.pdf">(Evidence SE6-1, Oncology Center of Excellence Meeting  Minutes, October 15, 2015) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During daily leader  rounding, Little noted through discussions with family members that some  families did not understand the end of life process and what to expect. Little  would assess the patient and ask family members if they understood why their  loved one was having breathing changes, why their chest was rattling or other  signs of the dying process. Little investigated further and, based on family  members&rsquo; responses to questions she asked them, determined that some staff members  were not effectively teaching patients and families about the end of life  process. Little would then provide the family with education on what to expect  with the changes in breathing and other symptoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One factor affecting the  family education being provided was 2 South&rsquo;s 18% clinical nurse turnover rate in  the previous 12-18 months, which would indicate some inexperience with teaching  patients and family members about the end of life process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Educational Activity Focused on Improving Nurses&rsquo; Expertise in  Teaching</strong><br>
On December 12, 2015, Little  and Beaumont Hospice arranged for four 30-minute presentations to be provided  to the 2 South staff.  The education  program, &ldquo;Management of untoward symptoms at the end of life,&rdquo; was provided at  various dates and times to make it accessible to clinical nurses on both the  midnight shift and day shift. The program was provided from 0600-0630 and  1400-1430 on the following dates: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wednesday, January 27, 2016 (one presentation)</li>
  <li>Monday, February 1, 2016 (one presentation)</li>
  <li>Wednesday, February 3, 2016 (two presentations)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McKenzie came to 2 South on these dates to provide the clinical  nurses with education on the management of untoward symptoms at the end of  life. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE6-2.pdf">(Evidence SE6-2, Presentation –  &ldquo;Management of Untoward Symptoms at the End of Life&rdquo; and 
  Attendance List) </a><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During McKenzie&rsquo;s education sessions, he explained the importance  of recognizing the patient&rsquo;s changes throughout the end of life process. The topics  discussed were management of anxiety/agitation, delirium, constipation,  diarrhea, dyspnea, secretions, nausea/vomiting and pain, along with effective  teaching strategies. He stressed that the patient and family should be taught  that these are normal responses and should be expected. McKenzie also reviewed  the importance of properly explaining what nurses are doing for their family  member, and of notifying the clinical nurse if their loved one is having any  signs of distress. The clinical nurses were asked to &ldquo;commit to sit&rdquo; to provide  effective teaching to the patient and family and to reinforce the education as  needed. &ldquo;Committing to sit&rdquo; involves  the clinical nurse sitting at the bedside eye to eye with the patients and  family and providing the teaching. A total of 32 clinical nurses (91%) and two  Assistant Nurse Managers attended the 30-minute educational sessions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Education Resources to  Improve Nurses&rsquo; Knowledge</strong><br>
  Four Hospice education modules were added to Beaumont Grosse Pointe nursing mandatories, which the nurses on 2 South complete  annually. These modules are located on Halogen, a web-based program that  Beaumont Health uses to deliver online education to its staff members. Halogen  was designed by Beaumont University, which is the corporate educational arm of  Beaumont Health. The new modules were also added to the new hire orientation for  clinical nurses on 2 South.&nbsp;The four modules focus on the following topics:  &ldquo;Introduction to Beaumont Hospice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Managing Pain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Management of End of Life  Symptoms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Principles of Death and Dying.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE6-3.pdf">(Evidence SE6-3, BGP In-Patient Nursing Corporate  Mandatories) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses are required to review the four education modules annually  to increase their knowledge and their ability to educate patient and families.  The following is a synopsis of the four education modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>Introduction  to Beaumont Hospice</u></strong> identifies the role of Hospice, the model of  care, vision and goals. It outlines the benefits of Hospice and the different  levels of care for patients on Hospice such as routine, continuous home care,  acute inpatient care and respite.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Managing  Pain</u></strong> teaches the nurse the signs and symptoms of pain the patient may experience  and how to effectively manage the patient&rsquo;s pain. Relaxation techniques,  medication management, recognizing nonverbal behaviors associated with pain and  how to include family members in assisting with the management of pain.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Management  of End of Life Symptoms</u></strong> outlines the core principles for end of life  care. The module reviews common symptoms such as nutrition/hydration, breathing  changes, anxiety, delirium, constipation, dyspnea/respiratory distress,  secretions, nausea/vomiting, pain and how to control these symptoms. A section  on education of the family that these are the symptoms of the end of life and  should be expected during this process.  </li>
  <li><strong><u>Principles  of Death and Dying</u></strong> defines what is death and dying. It provides  the clinical nurse with what to expect during the death and dying process  beginning with weeks to days before death. The syndrome of imminent death and  how to support the family during this time to ensure that they understand the  death and dying process. The final topic  is care of the body after death.   </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of  Education on Patient/Family Education</strong> <br>
  Once the classes and  modules were completed, it was expected that clinical nurses would teach the  patient and family about the dying process and what the nurses are doing for  their loved ones. Audits were conducted on the education being provided to the patient  and family members in the patient&rsquo;s chart. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE6-4.pdf">(Evidence SE6-4, EMR-Patient Education Documentation)</a> During daily leader rounding, Little would  assess families&rsquo; knowledge of symptoms and the dying process and listen for any  concerns or misunderstandings. Families often complimented the clinical nurses  for ensuring their understanding. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE6-5.pdf">(Evidence SE6-5, Family Letter) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colleen Knurek, LMSW, Beaumont  Hospice, reported to Little a compliment from a patient and family who said the  clinical nurses were wonderful with providing education about what to expect  during the end of life and disease processes and with providing emotional  support. Knurek said the family was able to verbalize the patient&rsquo;s changes in  breathing patterns and knew when they needed to call the clinical nurse to help  keep their loved one comfortable. The family said the clinical nurses taught  them what to expect with the change in breathing, so it did not alarm them as  much. The clinical nurse ensured the patient was provided respect, comfort and  dignity during end of life care, and used the most appropriate measures to  alleviate pain and other physical symptoms. This was accomplished by the nurse explaining  to the family members and patient the signs and symptoms of end of life and  what to expect. Providing patients and families with this information helped  them understand what to expect and how to deal with the situation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nurse provided the  family with techniques such as being present, sitting with their loved one and  talking to them, and helped them understand that even though their loved one cannot  engage in conversation this does not mean that they cannot hear them. The  family was also taught about providing soft music for their family member,  moist compresses if their family member is too warm and emotional support to  the family member during the end of life process. The family expressed their  understanding of how to play a role in their loved one&rsquo;s care to ensure  comfort, and their decreased anxiety through the knowledge provided by the  clinical nurse. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
