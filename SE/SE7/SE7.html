</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Transition of New Graduate Nurses  into the Nurse Practice Environment – Graduate Nurse Residency Program </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding to Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong><br>
  All new  graduate nurses onboarding to Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) are required to  attend corporate, hospital and nursing orientation and the Graduate Nurse  Residency Program. The corporate orientation is a four-hour session in which  all corporate information is reviewed, hospital-specific information is covered  in the hospital orientation and nursing orientation is a five-day program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  five-day BGP nursing orientation, completed with Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak,  includes the mandatory education expectations, electronic medical record  education and nursing skills that are deemed difficult, high-frequency or high-risk.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-1.pdf">(Evidence SE7-1, RN Nursing  Orientation Agenda) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graduate nurses  are also required to attend a one-day BGP nursing orientation, consisting of  hospital-specific content that is adjusted based on the recommendation of the  nursing leadership team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  complexity of patient care today requires highly competent clinical nurses who  use research and other forms of evidence to guide practice to ensure patient  safety and quality care. The stress of the transition from student to  practicing professional clinical nurse is exacerbated by the unrealistic  expectation that one will quickly come to function as a competent nurse.  Clinical experience in academic programs is limited, and new graduate nurses  (GN) are quickly faced with the reality of making critical decisions for the  first time in their careers. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has reported that  new GNs are leaving the profession in large numbers, as high as 20% during  their first year of practice and 34% during their first two years. Acute care  nursing orientation programs of six to 10 weeks with a nurse preceptor end with  little follow-up and support for the orientee. The impact of new graduate  competency on patient safety is significant and cannot be ignored. Beaumont&rsquo;s  Graduate Nurse Residency Program provides a comprehensive approach by providing  clinical education, competency evaluation and mentorship for GNs through their  first year of practice.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the many benefits of graduate nurse residency programs cited in the nursing  literature, Beaumont Health decided to offer a GN Residency Program beginning  in 2012.This  is a shared program between three hospitals in Beaumont Health: Grosse Pointe,  Troy and Royal Oak. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Graduate Nurse Residency Program</strong><br>
  The GN  Residency Program was designed by the Clinical Nurse Specialists at Beaumont  Grosse Pointe, Royal Oak and Troy. The program is currently overseen by Clinical  Nurse Specialists Angela Falzarano, MSN, RN-BC, from Beaumont Grosse Pointe;  Caroline Medcoff, MSN, RN, CNN, from Beaumont Royal Oak; and Phyllis Staniec,  MSN, RN, CPN, from Beaumont Troy. The hospitals rotate the responsibility for  each month&rsquo;s session. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose  of the program is to give new GNs the support and education required to  successfully transition from school to professional practice. There is a  learning gap between what new GNs know when they graduate from a nursing  program and the skills needed to perform proficiently in successful practice.  The new GN can easily feel isolated, incompetent and frustrated. The GN  Residency Program helps to counteract feelings of isolation by giving nurse  residents the opportunity to bond with other new nurses and to build a support  network with their peers, Clinical Nurse Specialists, preceptors and administrative  managers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of the GN Residency Program are to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Facilitate a smooth transition to practice by  bridging education and nursing practice</li>
  <li>Provide ongoing support and mentoring for new  GNs throughout their first year of entry into practice</li>
  <li>Introduce the GNs to numerous Beaumont  nursing experts and other Health System resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GN Residency Program provides the  following benefits:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Clinical       Nurse Specialists guide educational activities in a variety of settings to       allow the learners to take an active role in the learning process.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The learning activities that       are used promote&nbsp;critical thinking and problem solving. These       activities include simulation, case studies and clinical narratives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>It facilitates a smooth transition to practice by  bridging education and nursing practice. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>New GNs are provided ongoing       support and mentoring throughout their first year of entry into practice.</li>
  <li>New GNs are introduced to       numerous Beaumont nursing experts and other Health System resources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>New GNs are given the opportunity to develop their organization  and prioritization skills. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-2.pdf">(Evidence SE7-2, Information about GN Residency Program  from Website)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN Residency Program Commitment</strong><br>
  Upon hire, GNs  sign the Graduate Nurse Residency Agreement. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-3.pdf">(Evidence SE7-3, Commitment Letter for GN Residency) By  signing this agreement, GNs agree to attend a total of 48 hours of paid  classroom time over 12 months as </a>part of the GN Residency Program. Each month,  the four-hour class is offered at five different times. The topics rotate by  month, as shown in the table below. The topic from May is repeated in October, and  there is no class in December. GNs must attend a total of 10 classes to  successfully complete the series </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total  of 500 GNs participated in the 2016 Beaumont Health GN Residency Program: 53  from Beaumont Grosse Pointe, 189 from Beaumont Troy and 258 from Beaumont Royal Oak. The  following topics are reviewed in the GN Residency Program, which is a rolling  12-month program that GNs usually start in their second month of employment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evidence-based  practice is one topic that is discussed at length in the GN Residency Program.  This program is 3.5 hours long, with 3.5 contact hours awarded. The objectives  of the program are to:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe  the five steps in Melynk &amp; Fineout-Overholt&rsquo;s Model of Evidence-based  practice</li>
    <li>Conduct  a review of the literature using an evidence-based nursing electronic database</li>
    <li>Identify  key points in appraising evidence</li>
    <li>Develop  an implementation plan using information from the workshop</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  end of each class, the participants complete a written evaluation to provide  feedback that is used to improve the classes. The Clinical Nurse Specialist and  Education Specialist group review the evaluations annually and make changes to  the agenda as needed based on the feedback provided in the course evaluations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating the Graduate  Nurse Residency Program for Effectiveness</strong><br>
  Nurse Managers are provided an attendance grid  each month to show GNs&rsquo; progress through the program. The Administrative Nurse  Managers ensure that GNs have scheduled time off the unit to attend the classes.  Once the GNs complete the residency program, they receive a certificate signed  by the Chief Nursing Officer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GN Residency Program is evaluated monthly  at each session by the Clinical Nurse Specialists from each hospital who run the program and the GNs in attendance.  The GNs complete the Casey-Fink Graduate  Nurse Experience Survey, which is administered when they have two months, six  months and 12 months of experience.  The  survey measures how well the GN is transitioning from the role of graduate  nurse to clinical nurse. Once a year, the Directors of Education and Research  and the Clinical Nurse Specialist from Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Beaumont Royal  Oak and Beaumont Troy meet to review the program evaluation and the Casey-Fink  data to determine the program for the following year and adjust the content  based on the program evaluations. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-5.pdf">(Evidence SE7-5, 2015 Casey-Fink Graduate Nurse Experience Survey</a>) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Transition of a Newly Hired Experienced Infusion Nurse into the Work  Environment of Beaumont Grosse Pointe Infusion Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding to Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong><br>
  For nurses hired from outside Beaumont  Health, orientation begins with the one-day corporate orientation. The  experienced outpatient clinical nurse attends only days one and two of the  combined nursing orientation program at Royal Oak, since the remaining days of  that program have an inpatient emphasis that is not applicable to the  outpatient practice setting. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-1.pdf">(Evidence  SE7-1, RN Nursing Orientation Agenda)</a>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All mandatory Halogen education (web-based  education activities) must be completed prior to working in the clinical area.  All computer-based training related to the electronic medical record, Epic oneChart,  must be completed before the nurse is granted access to that software.  </p>
<p>At the time of hire, experienced nurses  are assigned a &ldquo;Friend at Work&rdquo; who serves as the primary preceptor when they begin  practicing in the clinical area.<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-6.pdf">(Evidence  SE7-6, Friend at Work Memo and Program)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nursing  Orientation</strong><br>
  On the first day of orientation the newly  hired experienced clinical nurse is provided a folder with an orientation  competency checklist. This serves as a preliminary needs assessment to identify  whether the experienced nurse needs assistance or is inexperienced in any  specific performance criteria. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-7.pdf">(Evidence  SE7-7, Overall, Orientation Competency Checklist)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each performance criterion is validated  by the preceptor throughout the orientation process. New Outpatient Infusion clinical  nurses meet with Josephine Garnoc, MSN, RN, CRNI, OCN, Director of Infusion  Center, on the first day to determine the required length of orientation and the  frequency of days available to orient. Orientation days are scheduled as  consistently as possible to facilitate learning the new work environment and  the transition to being integrated into the department. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-8.pdf">(Evidence SE7-8, Individual Nursing Competency  Checklist)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new nurse is  welcomed to meet and speak with the Director at any time during the orientation  process. A meeting is held with the nurse at 90 days to review progress toward  completing department-specific competencies and general progress, with input  from the preceptors. The length of orientation is also impacted by the nurse&rsquo;s  previous infusion practice, given the wide variety of medications that are administered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the new nurse does not have an Oncology  Nursing Society Biotherapy and Chemotherapy Provider Care, it is expected that  this will be completed within the first six months of employment. Following the  completion of this online course, the newly hired experienced nurse is observed  administering chemotherapy three times in accord with the established  guidelines from the Oncology Nurses Society for the Clinical Practicum  Evaluation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sandra Moore, RN, clinical nurse,  Infusion Center was hired as a contingent clinical nurse, which is a  non-benefit employee. They have no set hours and are scheduled to work at the  discretion of the unit. Moore&rsquo;s 33 years of experience as a nurse included  inpatient oncology. Her most recent practice was working in a physician&rsquo;s office  for nine years doing biological infusions for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and bisphosphonates for osteoporosis.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moore attended corporate onboarding on  her first day, October 12, 2015. The orientation plan was for Moore to be at Infusion  Services from October 14-16, 2015 to set up her password, complete all the online  education that is required before working in the clinical area and complete all  the required computer-based training for access to the electronic medical  record, which was part of nursing orientation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garnoc started with introducing Moore to  the staff and giving her a tour of the unit and building to see the Infusion  Services routine. Garnoc also met with Moore to discuss the length of orientation  based on her experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moore was very skilled in IV starts and  accessing implanted venous access devices, and she knew the established  protocols from the office she had previously worked in, which had only minor  differences that were discovered when assessing her office practice. Moore  indicated that it had been many years since she had administered chemotherapy  and that those medications had changed a great deal, along with all the other  medications that are administered in the Ambulatory Infusion Center (AIC). Garnoc  and Moore agreed that once the required mandatory education was completed, the  orientation would focus on the medications she had the most experience with to  learn the differences in the protocols and antibiotics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Individualized  Orientation Plan</strong><br>
  Moore was paired with Ruth Knipstein,  RN, clinical nurse preceptor, who was also assigned to be her &ldquo;Friend at Work.&rdquo;  Knipstein sent Moore an email prior to her start date to welcome her. During  breaks from the computer, Moore and Garnoc talked about the work schedule,  requesting days off, holiday/weekend requirements and other department  policies. It was determined that the department-specific competency  demonstrations would be started once the online mandatory education activities were  completed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been several years since Moore had  practiced in a hospital setting, so a specific number of days for orientation  was not set at the beginning. Needs evaluations were performed as she  progressed in her transition process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contingent nurses are not required to  engage in the orientation full-time, but Garnoc explained that the process  could in this case take longer. As she was transitioning from office practice  to the hospital setting, Moore agreed that consistency would reinforce the  learning experience and facilitate the orientation process and integration. Garnoc  and Moore together determined that she would orient two to three days a week,  with the length of orientation to be determined as it progressed, with input  from preceptors.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moore was very confident with the  medications she had administered in the past and with delivering patient care,  but she found that documentation was a challenge and was taking longer to  master. All of the staff members reassured her that it had been the same for them  when they began to use the electronic medical record and that it just takes  time and practice.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four weeks into orientation, Moore told  Garnoc that she felt she had made a mistake taking this position and that she  was more of a hindrance than a help and was slowing down her preceptors. Moore said  she was fine with the patient care aspect, but that she was uncomfortable and  frustrated with the computer documentation and other aspects of the work flow.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As consistency and practice reinforces  learning, they determined together, with input from her preceptor, that Moore  would work three days a week and have them as close to each other as possible. They  reviewed the progress of her orientation and determined that Moore had  completed the competency demonstrations, protocols, policies, corporate  compliance, process of referring patients to the Infusion Center and routine  work flows. Moore was willing to assist other nurses for the opportunity to learn  new medications and to be part of the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient care was not an issue, as Moore  made connections with her patients easily and practiced in accord with </p>
<p>the Infusion  Nurses Society (INS) and Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) standards of care, and  hospital policy and protocols related to patient care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They identified the greatest challenge  and source of frustration as documentation on the computer, placing lab orders  in Soft (BGP&rsquo;s electronic specimen collection system) and navigating the EMR.  Garnoc, Moore and her preceptordetermined that since she had confidence and  skill in patient care, the current objective was to support Moore&rsquo;s learning  and acquiring basic mastery of the EMR. In December 2015, a revised orientation  plan was developed for Moore to gain experience by working with the preceptor  and do all the navigation and documentation on the medical record, enter lab  orders and print the labels for any labs, complete the treatment summaries and  send them to the physicians, and then close the encounters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three weeks into this new orientation  direction, Moore reported that this approach made a big difference and that  working the consecutive days allowed her to repeat the learned skills of  computer documentation, ordering labs, printing labels and finding what she  needed on the EMR, while also providing patient care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She indicated she still took longer than  the other nurses but was no longer feeling that she had made a mistake in  taking the position. She enjoys her new role, being part of the team and being  able to fulfill all aspects of her position other than administering  chemotherapy. According to ONS, new nurses should have at least six months of exposure  to chemotherapy before completing the ONS Biotherapy and Chemotherapy Provider  online course. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time gives learners some familiarity with the agents and allows  them to observe the process of chemotherapy calculation double checks,  laboratory values, patient education and safe handling of hazardous drugs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was the next phase of orientation,  since Moore completed her official orientation on January 22, 2016 and would be  counted in staffing numbers on the schedule beginning January 24, 2016.  Moore completed 32 days of orientation, which  amounted to 256 hours, in addition to self-directed reading at home to enhance  her learning and confidence in the clinical area.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation  of the Effectiveness of the Transition Process for Newly Hired Experienced  Nurses </strong><br>
  The transition of a newly hired  experienced nurse is evaluated through her or his completion of the nursing  competencies and through the employee appraisal system. The Director of the  Infusion Center meets with the employee to discuss her or his progress along  with the preceptor; if all the competencies are met, the clinical nurse has  completed the transition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The employee appraisal  system is another means of evaluating the transition. Moore was given a score  or 3.7 (out of 5) on her 2016 employee appraisal, which mean she is functioning  in the commendable range. Both of these evaluation measures demonstrate that  Moore has successfully transitioned to being a clinical nurse in the Infusion Center.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-9.pdf">(Evidence SE9-9, Moore 2016  Employee Appraisal)</a></p>
