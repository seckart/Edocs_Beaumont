<p><strong><em>Nurses  are recognized for their contributions in addressing the strategic priorities  of the organization.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of recognition of a clinical nurse for his or her  contribution(s) in addressing the strategic priorities of the organization.</em></p>
  <p><strong><em>AND</em></strong><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Clinical Nurse Barbara Sheppard Recognized for Supporting the Strategic Priority of Providing  Safe, Quality Patient Care</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Priority</strong><br>
  &ldquo;Provide safe, quality patient care&rdquo; is  identified in the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) 2014-2016 Strategic Planning Process,  hospital-based initiatives. The goals identified for safe and quality care are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify  safe themes, reinforce department action plans, meet with directors and support  the plans.</li>
  <li>Share  executive safety rounds overview and write up with department staff.</li>
  <li>Develop  an action plan, by domain, and initiate BGP specific first steps to improve  service: Clean, Quiet, Meds and Doctors.</li>
  <li>Actively  work the HCAHPS work plans.<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-1.pdf">(Evidence SE11-1 2014-2016 Strategic Planning Process, page  3)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issues Related to Providing  Safe, Quality Patient Care</strong><br>
  In August 2015, Barbara Sheppard, RN, C-EFM approached  Patricia Heitz, RNC-OB, C-EFM, Assistant Nurse Manager of the Family Birth  Center (FBC), with concerns about things she was witnessing on the unit. Sheppard  is an experienced nurse with 10 years of critical care experience and seven years  of experience in the FBC. She also serves as a preceptor for new nurses for the  FBC. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard, who has seen the ebbs and flows of  staffing, began her career in FBC on the midnight shift and moved to days. Her  vast experience positions her to assess new clinical nurses as they proceed  through orientation, including their ability to adapt to the particularities of  their shift. She is able to judge and define strengths, weaknesses and how past  experiences can assist the staff as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard raised the idea of having the more  experienced nurses on the day shift work for a time on the midnight shift to  mentor its nurses and strengthen the shift as a whole.<br>
  The unit, particularly on the midnight shift,  had an increase both in new nurses and nurses who had no experience in the obstetric  specialty. At the time that Sheppard raised this idea, the midnight shift had a  very inexperienced clinical nursing staff. It did, however, have an experienced  Obstetric Assistant Nurse Manager assigned to the shift, Janice Davis, BSN,  RNC-OB, C-EFM. The following is a sampling of the midnight shift staff members:</p>

<p align="center">SE11, Sampling of Midnight  Shift Nurses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add to the complexity of the staffing  struggles, four nurses had active intermittent family leaves that were being  used frequently, and one nurse was out on pregnancy-related complications. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The composition of the staff included some  strong nurses, but the majority were newer nurses working in this highly  stressful environment. The midnight shift nurses shared their feeling of being  stressed with their counterparts on the day shift. Sheppard took their thoughts  and feelings to heart and came up with an idea to bolster not only the  confidence of the midnight shift, but also the specialty that is practiced a  labor and delivery unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard discussed the issue with other day  shift nurses and enlisted Zoe Bates, RN, C-EFM and Norine Fuerth, BSN, RN,  C-EFM, who were willing to help with mentoring  the midnight shift. Sheppard convinced Bates and Fuerth to move to the midnight  shift to assist the new clinical nurses in providing safe, quality care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard, Bates and Fuerth then discussed the  idea with Heitz, who decided that she was able to allow these nurses to safely float  to the midnight shift by enlisting the help of part-time nurses to fill in the day shifts. They collaboratively decided  that the three nurses would work the midnight shift for three months. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-2.pdf">(Evidence SE11-2, Work Schedules  for Clinical Nurses on FBC)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During their time on the midnight shift, their  duties were to partner with the newer nurses to serve as clinical resources and  to help them develop a variety of skills. The specific tasks they accomplished  included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advancing  two nurses up to level 2 nursery to enable them to care for ill newborns</li>
  <li>Training  new nurses to become scrub nurses  </li>
  <li>Completing  orientation for nurses on the midnight shift,  serving in the preceptor role</li>
  <li>Serving  as resource nurses for all new night shift staff members</li>
  <li>Reviewing  opening the OR for STAT cesarean section procedures</li>
  <li>Reviewing  OB emergencies:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Neonatal  resuscitation with infant transfer to nursery for observation</li>
    <li>Shoulder  dystocia</li>
    <li>Postpartum  hemorrhage drills </li>
    <li>STAT  cesarean section drills </li>
    <li>D&amp;C  set-up</li>
    <li>Use  and review of new equipment, e.g., yellowfins</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These three nurses were not counted in the  daily staffing, as the intention was for them to serve as resources, mentors  and a source of strength for the less experienced clinical nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heitz shared the idea with Anne Stewart, MBA,  BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer. Stewart was  receptive to its uniqueness and appreciated the empathy and caring that these  engaged nurses showed toward the midnight shift and the less experienced clinical  nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong><br>
  Sheppard was recognized in a number of ways for  her ability to ensure that safe, quality care was provided on the Family Birth  Center.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sheppard  was recognized by being nominated for the Nightingale Award in the category of  Staff Nurse Practice. The Nightingale Awards are given by Oakland University  School of Nursing in Rochester, Michigan to the outstanding nurses in the  Detroit Metropolitan area. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-3.pdf">(Evidence  SE11-3, Nomination form for Nightingale Award for Barbara Sheppard)</a></li>
  <li>Stewart  was able to secure additional funding for Sheppard, which was paid hourly to  the three nurses when they worked the midnight shift to compensate them for  their willingness to go above and beyond to foster and strengthen the unit&rsquo;s  ability to render safe, quality care. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-4.pdf">(Evidence SE11-4, January 20, 2016 Memo Outlining Compensation)</a> While  these nurses had never asked for additional compensation for their efforts,  they were needless to say happy and they appreciated that management was open  to unique suggestions from the staff about how to effectively make a difference  on their unit.</li>
  <li>Sheppard  was recognized at the Nursing Excellence Day, during Nurses Week, on May 11,  2016 for being nominated for various awards. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In  January 2017, Sheppard was recognized at the hospital level with a Beaumont  Star Award for the outstanding care she provides to her patients. These awards  are given by the hospital president to employees who excel in their positions. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-5.pdf">(Evidence SE11-5, Memo from the Nurses  Week Task Force and Star Award)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard&rsquo;s co-workers often praise her for her  efforts in this endeavor, which were also recognized in her performance appraisals.  Her idea demonstrated her willingness to be innovative and forward thinking in  the quest to strengthen the unit in both spirit and skill.<br>
  This inventive idea, along with Sheppard&rsquo;s  stellar bedside care and mentoring of both new and seasoned staff members,  demonstrates the commitment to the BGP Strategic Priority of providing safe,  quality care to our patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Recognizing Nurse Leaders for  Obtaining BSN Degrees</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Priority</strong><br>
  Achieving Magnet® designation was  identified as a Strategic Priority in the 2014-2016 Strategic Planning Process.  The goal was to begin the process in 2014, with a Magnet submission date of  2017-2018. Three goals were identified in the Strategic Planning Documents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain  a consultant to assist in the process</li>
  <li>Complete  a gap analysis </li>
  <li>Begin  the search for, recruit and hire a Magnet Program Director.<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-1.pdf">Evidence SE11-1,  2014-2016 Strategic Planning Process) </a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gap Analysis</strong><br>
  Eligibility  criteria for Magnet designation include 100% of nurse managers and nurse leaders  having either a baccalaureate or graduate degree in nursing at the time of  application. In early 2015, a gap analysis completed at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  showed that some of its nurse leaders did not  have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in nursing. The leaders  identified as not having at least a BSN were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Molly  Brieden, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, 3 West</li>
    <li>Derek  Forman, RN, Administrative Manager, IP Surgery</li>
    <li>Patricia  Heitz, RN, C-EFM, Assistant Nurse Manager, Family Birth Center</li>
    <li>Charlotta  Marion, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, Emergency Center</li>
    <li>Susan  Muscat, RN, BS, Director of Quality Management</li>
    <li>Marie  Reinman, RN, Director of Heart &amp; Vascular and Critical Care Nursing</li>
    <li>Alexis  Rogers, RN, ONC, Assistant Nurse Manager, Orthopedic Unit</li>
  </ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, discussed  the issue of nurse leaders&rsquo; education with Maureen Bowman, MA, BSN, RN, NEA-BC,  Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at Beaumont Royal Oak, which is a  Magnet-designated hospital. Bowman said that Beaumont Royal Oak had had the  same issue and was able to supplement the education benefits for nurse leaders  who needed to pursue an advanced nursing degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Leaders&rsquo; Commitment to Obtain a BSN  Degree</strong><br>
  Stewart  approached Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President, about the idea of  enhanced education benefits for nurses who needed to obtain a BSN degree so BGP  could achieve its strategic priority of achieving Magnet designation. Swaine  agreed with Stewart, and Stewart began working with Human Resources to develop  a plan similar to the one used at Beaumont Royal Oak for Enhanced Educational  Assistance Benefit for nurse leaders to obtain a BSN degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June  2015, Stewart met with nurse leaders to review and sign the Enhanced  Educational Assistance Benefit Agreement. The agreement consisted of the  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  nurse leader must enroll in a BSN program and graduate with a BSN degree by  December 31, 2016.</li>
  <li>The  nurse leader needs to provide proof to Human Resources of graduation completion  by December 31, 2016.</li>
  <li>If  the nurse leader is unable to complete the education requirement by December  31, 2016 they will be displaced from their current position.</li>
  <li>The  nurse leader agrees to work for BGP for 24 months after graduation.</li>
  <li>If  the nurse leader leaves before 24 months or does not graduate, all enhanced  benefits must be paid back to BGP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enhanced Educational  Benefit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beaumont  Health System will provide additional educational reimbursement in the amount  of $6,000 annually (total of $12,000) over and above the current $2,000 annual  benefit to further support education.</li>
  <li>In  exchange for these enhanced education benefits, a 24-month work commitment is required  at Beaumont Grosse Pointe.<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-6.pdf">(Evidence SE11-6, Enhanced Education Assistance Benefit  Agreement Letter)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The seven  nurse leaders signed the agreement and enrolled in various schools to complete  the education by December 31, 2016. Forman and Reinman experienced some  difficulties early in the process. They had received their basic nursing  education in Canada, and one university that they applied to informed them that  it would not accept some of the credits and that they would have to repeat some  courses. After receiving this information, Forman and Reinman both enrolled in  another university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six of  the seven nurse leaders graduated on time, as shown in the following table: </p>

<p><strong>Recognition Events</strong><br>
  These  nurse leaders were recognized individually and as a group. They were recognized  in the following ways for obtaining BSN degrees in support of the BGP strategic  initiative of achieving Magnet designation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brieden,  Heitz, Marion and Rogers received promotions and a substantial increase in their  compensation and benefit package. Their titles were changed from Assistant  Nurse Manager to Administrative Manager, and they were moved from regular  payroll to executive payroll. Executive payroll provides an enhanced benefit  package and less out of pocket expenses. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-8.pdf">(Evidence SE11-8, Justification for Employee Salary Increase)</a></li>
  <li>The  Nurse Leaders Group was recognized at the December 2016 Monthly Leadership  Meeting, which is attended by all hospital leaders to discuss topics that  affect the entire hospital. </li>
  <li>The  Nurse Leaders Group was also recognized by Stewart at the Medical Executive Board  on January 17, 2017. The Executive Board was very complimentary of the group of  nurse leaders who obtained a BSN degree.</li>

<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE11-9.pdf">(Evidence  SE11-9, Minutes of Medical Executive Board, January 17, 2017)</a></p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The  Nurse Leaders Group was also recognized by the hospital at a dinner on January  17, 2017 at Andiamo Trattoria. This event was held in honor of the six nurses  who earned a BSN degree. In addition to the dinner celebration, all of the  nurse leaders received a small token of appreciation from the hospital. The following  people joined in recognizing the six honorees:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Rick  Swaine, Hospital President</li>
