  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preceptor  Education Program Offered by Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) participates  in a robust Nurse Preceptor Workshop that is offered to experienced nurses who  are currently precepting or would like to precept new clinical nurses. This  workshop provides nurse preceptors with evidence-based skills to build  supportive one-on-one teaching and learning relationships with new nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop was originally developed in  2011with input from Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Beaumont Royal Oak and Beaumont  Troy. It is currently taught by the Educational Specialists from Beaumont Royal  Oak. At Beaumont Health, the workload is typically split between the three  North Hospitals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for qualified, experienced,  effective preceptors continues to grow as many of BGP&rsquo;s new hires are new nurse  graduates. The goal of the Nurse Preceptor Workshop is that at the end of the  program the preceptor will have the essential tools and ideas for practical  approaches to facilitate meeting the new nurse&rsquo;s adult learning style, validate  competencies and develop critical feedback and evaluation skills. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of the Nurse  Preceptor Workshop</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe  the preceptor roles and responsibilities</li>
  <li>Define  communication, critical thinking and emotional intelligence</li>
  <li>Identify  the steps for assessing and planning learning</li>
  <li>Describe  how to evaluate performance and provide feedback</li>
  <li>Discuss  challenging or difficult situations and how to manage conflict</li>
  <li>Discuss  how to develop a learning plan</li>
  <li>Discuss  the transition from preceptor to mentor</li>
  <li>Identify  current hot topics and issues to be included during the orientation period</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Frequency and Length of  the Program</strong><br>
  The Nurse Preceptor Workshop is offered  monthly at the PNC Building in Troy, Michigan. This is an off-site conference  center at which Beaumont Health rents classroom space for the education needs  of the employees of Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Beaumont Royal Oak and Beaumont  Troy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The participants of the class are  clinical nurses from three Beaumont hospitals: Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Royal  Oak, and Troy. The workshop is held from 0800–1400, and 4.5 continuing nurse  education contact hours are awarded by the Ohio Nurses Association via the American  Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) upon completing the class. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE8-1.pdf">(Evidence SE8-1, 2017 RN Preceptor  Workshop Advertisement and CE Agenda)</a></p>

<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE8-2.pdf">(Evidence SE8-2, PowerPoint Presentation  of Workshop)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preceptor  Selection</strong><br>
  Experienced nurses must indicate a  desire to be a preceptor, and the manager must give approval that the nurse is  a qualified candidate to be permitted into the Nurse Preceptor Workshop. Nurses  may approach the manager, or the manager may approach nurses about attending  the Nurse Preceptor Workshop. Preceptors are identified in many ways. A manager  may identify a potential preceptor by observing the clinical nurse providing  patient care, and clinical nurses are frequently identified during their  performance review. The manager will then inquire about their interest in  precepting. Clinical nurses may also be identified as potential preceptors if  they have been a preceptor for a registered nurse student for a local  university. Most nursing school in the Detroit area require a precepted  experience at a hospital.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses are paid to attend the workshop,  and they receive 4.5 contact hours along with a certificate of completion. For clinical  nurses participating in the Professional Ladder Program, the Nurse Preceptor  Workshop can be used to fulfill requirements of attendance at a leadership  course. In the past four years, 68 nurses from BGP attended the Nurse Preceptor  Workshop, including 17 in 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE8-3.pdf">(Evidence  SE8-3, Continuing Education and Attendance List from 2016 Workshops) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing  Evaluation of the Nurse Preceptor Workshop</strong><br>
  The Nurse Preceptor Workshop is evaluated  approximately every two years or more frequently if required. The Clinical  Nurse Specialists from all three hospitals and the instructors for the course  meet to review the content and make any necessary changes. They review the participants&rsquo;  evaluations of the class to determine whether it is still meeting the clinical  nurses&rsquo; needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop is evaluated in three ways:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>All  attendees evaluate the workshop after completing it. They are sent an online  evaluation that must be completed prior to receiving the CNE certificate. This  survey is used to evaluate the instructors&rsquo; ability to teach and whether the  objectives were met.</li>
  <li>Every  other year, the instructors review the course content for relevance and current  evidence-based practice and update it as needed. This course was originally  developed in 2011, and it was revised and updated in 2013, 2014 and 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE8-4.pdf">(Evidence SE8-4, RN Preceptor  Workshop Updates)</a></li>
  <li>Ongoing  feedback from the monthly evaluation surveys is used to ensure that the  workshop is meeting the needs of the preceptors, and adjustments are made as  indicated. The evaluations show that the Nurse Preceptor Workshop is very well  received, as demonstrated below. The instructors review the evaluations after each  workshop and scan them into the &ldquo;Nurse Dev&rdquo; shared drive so all three hospitals  have access to them. </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop has  historically been held six times a year, but with the addition of five new  hospitals to Beaumont Health it was decided to provide 12 classes in 2017. <br>
</p>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The October 13, 2016 Evaluation Summary showed that  88% of participants stated that they met the objectives for the Nurse Preceptor  Workshop. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE8-5.pdf">(Evidence SE8-5,  RN Preceptor Workshop November 21, 2016 Summative Evaluation and Individual  Activity Quality Improvement Tool) </a></p>
