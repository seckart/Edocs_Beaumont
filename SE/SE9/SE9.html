<h2>Commitment to Community Involvement SE9</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>The  organization supports nurses' participation in community healthcare outreach.</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>
  <p><em>Provide o</em><em>rovide one example,  with supporting evidence, of organizational support for nurse leader  involvement in community healthcare outreach.</em></p>
</li>
  <li> </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Beaumont Grosse Pointe Clinical  Nurses Providing Healthcare Outreach in the Community – Stroke Awareness and  Health Screenings</strong></p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is  committed to providing organizational support to nurses who participate in  community healthcare outreach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2016,Cathleen Solecki, MSN, RN, CCRN, CNRN, Clinical Program Manager,  was contacted by Suzy Berschback, Community Relations Manager for BGP, for organizational  support to facilitate clinical nurse involvement in several community outreach  events. Solecki agreed to solicit clinical nurses to participate in this  program.  Solecki and Berschback agreed  that the community outreach would focus on activities related to early  detection and prevention for community members who are at risk for strokes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recruitment  of Clinical Nurse Participants </strong><br>
  Solecki is in charge of the BGP Stroke  Champion program. Stroke Champions are clinical nurses who serve as key  stakeholders and function as resources and clinical experts with a strong  influence in process and action plans driving the Stroke Program from the  bedside. The Stroke Champion role is designed to improve clinical performance,  quality of care and process improvement opportunities. One of the requirements  of being a Stroke Champion nurse is to participate in at least one community  outreach event annually. (Evidence  SE9-1, Criteria for Being a Stroke Champion)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the outreach events, the clinical nurse  Stroke Champions provide stroke awareness, perform blood pressure checks and  ask the participants a series of questions to evaluate their cardiovascular  risks for a stroke. These questions cover blood  pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, atrial fibrillation, diet, exercise  and family history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outreach events that clinical nurses have participated  in include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power of the Heart –  focuses on heart health</li>
  <li>Girls Night Out –  stroke awareness and blood pressure screening</li>
  <li>Village Fest – stroke  awareness and blood pressure screening</li>
  <li>Stroke Awareness Month  – blood pressure and stroke risk assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outreach Activity  </strong><br>
  Theresa Lopez, RN, clinical nurse, Critical  Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU), has been employed by BGP for over seven years and has  been an active member of the Stroke Champions.   Working on the CCSU, Lopez has seen many patients have serious health  issues related to hypertension and strokes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lopez is quick to volunteer to participate  in any event that is related to hypertension and stroke awareness. One event,  held at BGP on May 25, 2017, is the stroke awareness event for Stroke Awareness  Month. The event, held in the BGP Lobby from 11 a.m.- 1 p.m., consisted of the  Stroke Champions providing blood pressure checks and stroke risk assessments. This  event is free to community members. The participants received a FASTER magnet  to learn the signs and symptoms of a stroke. FASTER stands for:<br>
  F= Face<br>
  A= Arm<br>
  S= Stability<br>
  T= Talking<br>
  E= Eyes<br>
  R= React</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 17, 2017, Solecki sent a reminder  email asking for additional Stroke Champions for the event, and Lopez volunteered.  Lopez participated in the stroke risk assessment, which includes questions  about a person&rsquo;s risk factors for stroke. The questions are reviewed and a  calculation is made to assess the participant&rsquo;s risk factors for stroke. This  could be low risk, caution or high risk. Based on the areas of risk identified,  the clinical nurse reviews ways to reduce their risk of stroke. The signs and  symptoms from the National Stroke Association are also reviewed, and the  participant is given a magnet with this information. The assessment along with  the blood pressure documented on it is also given to the participant. (Evidence SE9-2, Flyer for Stroke  Awareness Month, Email Asking for Volunteers, Stroke Risk Scorecard and Copy of  Magnet)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was a huge success, with almost  50 visitors, volunteers and employees being seen during its two hours. Solecki  sent an email thanking all the Stroke Champions for participating in the event.  (Evidence SE9-3, Thank You Email and Sign-in Sheets from Event)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organizational  Support</strong><br>
  BGP supports clinical nurses&rsquo;  involvement in community outreach in many ways. The support is provided by  leaders including the Chief Nursing Officer, the Stroke Program Manager and the  Administrative Managers on the unit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Flexible  Scheduling and Pay for Volunteering Time at Community Events</em><br>
  Whenever  a clinical nurse such as Lopez participates in community outreach, they are  paid for the time they are at the event. Administrative Managers support the clinical  nurses being compensated for the time they spend doing community outreach. When  Lopez participated in the stroke awareness event on May 25, 2017, she was paid  for the time she was there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Administrative Managers also support clinical nurses&rsquo; involvement in community  outreach by adjusting schedules to ensure they able to attend the outreach  activity. (Evidence SE9-4,  Email Regarding Paying Clinical Nurses for Outreach, Screen Shot of Lopez Time  and Attendance Sheet)</p>
<p><em>Advancement  on Clinical Ladder for Volunteering at Community Events</em><br>
  BGP also supports community outreach through  the Clinical Ladder Program. Points may be obtained in the Leadership sections  of the Clinical Ladders, with Volunteer Service including:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Volunteer Health  Related Activities- Not paid by Beaumont</li>
    <li>Volunteer Community  Activities- Sponsored by Beaumont</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both activities  allow for 1 point per hour, with a maximum of five or 10 points per activity. <a name="_Hlk485149117">(Evidence  SE9-5</a>, Holly  Kowal Professional Ladder Application) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Beaumont Nurse Leader Marie  Reinman Appointed to the Grosse Pointe Chamber of Commerce</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 20, 2015, Suzy Berschback,  Community Relations Manager for Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), contacted Marie  Reinman, RN, Director of Heart &amp; Vascular and Critical Care Nursing,  regarding a request from the Grosse Pointe Chamber of Commerce for a nursing  leader to be a member of the Quality of Life Committee (a subset of the Grosse  Pointe Chamber of Commerce). (Evidence  SE9-6, Memo from Suzy Berschback)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Involvement  in Community Outreach</strong><br>
  Berschback believed that as a resident of the  community of Grosse Pointe Farms and as the Director of Heart &amp; Vascular  Services and Critical Care Nursing, serving on the Quality of Life Committee  would be a good fit for Reinman, as she could offer input that would have value  for community healthcare outreach. Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital  President, and Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer, supported the endeavor, also believing that nurse leader involvement  would add value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of the Quality of Life Committee  are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create or support  opportunities for residents to come together to celebrate the community and  support area businesses</li>
  <li>Promote and encourage a  healthy community</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to BGP nurse leader Reinman, the members  of the committee included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jenny Boettcher,  Community Member</li>
  <li>Carlos Borrego,  Community Member</li>
  <li>Christina Klien,  Community Member</li>
  <li>Dr. David Balle,  Physician Community Member</li>
  <li>Thomas Harwood, Superintendent  of the Grosse Pointe School System</li>
  <li>Tomasine Marx, Vice  President of Finance of St. John Health</li>
  <li>Eric Turin, Attorney</li>
  <li>Stu Alderman, Director  of a local community center</li>
  <li>Alicia Carlisle, Local  business owner</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Community Healthcare Outreach  Activities</strong><br>
  </p>
<p><em>Butterfly  Bench Project</em><br>
  In 2014-2015, the broader Chamber of  Commerce sponsored a Butterfly Bench Project that involved local artists  painting benches sponsored by businesses, schools, community organizations and  private donors. The benches were auctioned to benefit a local senior charity  and remain sprinkled throughout the community </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>10,000  Step Journey</em><br>
  Reinman also supported the chamber&rsquo;s  10,000 Step Journey program, a way to encourage healthy activity, and tasked  the Quality of Life Committee with finding a way to connect this initiative to  the Butterfly Bench Project to celebrate Grosse Pointe as a walkable community.  Reinman, with the support of BGP, was instrumental in developing a plan to tie  together the 10,000 Step Journey walkable community project and the Butterfly  Bench Project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Planning  for the Walkable Community</em><br>
  At a meeting held on February 10, 2015,  the Quality of Life Committee discussed how to tie the healthy activity of  walking to the Butterfly Benches Project. They decided to create a small,  laminated map marking points of interest and providing mileage between points. They  agreed that walks between the benches would be a good starting point for a  walking map, which would also focus on the artistry of Grosse Pointe  residents.  The committee members with  marketing connections agreed to find out what this might cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the March 10, 2015 meeting, the group  discussed the possibility of incorporating local landmarks and creating different  routes based on these; for example, a retail route in the commercial shopping  district and routes between schools, churches, clubs and hospitals. The  distance between these landmarks was easily calculated, and the benches became  points of interest or rest stops on the routes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinman suggested that BGP consider  donating pedometers to support the initiative, which it did. The committee  started looking at how the map would be distributed to the community members,  deciding that this would be done at community events, local newcomers  organizations or through the chamber itself.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since local businesses were highlighted  on routes, there was also the possibility of having the cost of the map underwritten  based on sponsorships or revenue generated by placing advertisements on the  back of the map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subcommittee continued to meet every  other month between May and December 2015, and it further developed the map by adding  parks, City Halls of the individual Grosse Pointes and historic sites. (Evidence SE9-7, Quality of Life Meeting  Minutes, February 10, 2015, May 12, 2015 and July 14, 2015) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A final draft of the map was ready for  production by December 2015, complete with sponsorship and enough advertising  to pay for printing and laminating the maps. In March 2016, St. John Health  offered to provide water bottles since BGP had offered pedometers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By April 2016, the printed maps were available  and planned for distribution at the Chamber of Commerce office, local parks,  and fitness and community centers.   Although there was no scientific data to support its success, the  committee members heard very positive anecdotal responses to the map. It  generated a lot of interest in the routes, and people found it an interesting,  innovative way to promote a healthy lifestyle and to promote the community as  walking-friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Support</strong><br>
  Beaumont  Grosse Pointe supports Reinman&rsquo;s involvement in participation in community  outreach.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BGP supported Reinman  in her position on the Quality of Life Committee by supporting the Walkable Community/Butterfly  Bench Project. BGP purchased a butterfly bench that sits in the healing garden  on the hospital campus. (Evidence  SE9-8, Thank You Letter from Grosse Pointe Chamber Foundation) BGP also purchased pedometers for community  members to monitor the number of steps they took while using the walking maps  developed by the Quality of Life Committee. (Evidence SE9-9, Thank You Letter from Grosse Pointe  Chamber of Commerce, Map and Flyer)</li>
  <li>BGP supports Reinman for  her community outreach by supporting her attendance at the monthly Chamber of  Commerce meetings, which are held at 7 a.m., during work time. (Evidence SE9-10, Reinman&rsquo;s Calendar  for February 10, 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont  Grosse Pointe encourages and supports nurse leaders to participate in community  healthcare outreach. BGP&rsquo;s support for Reinman&rsquo;s participation on the Chamber  of Commerce Quality of Life Committee is one example of this support.  </p>
