<h2>Commitment to Professional Development SE5</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Nursing  education opportunities are provided for those interested in a nursing career.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of a career development opportunity provided by the  organization for non-nurse employees or members of the community interested in  becoming a registered nurse. This example may include community partnership  activities.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Career  Development Opportunity Provided by Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) offers a career development opportunity to students from two  local community high schools. Grosse Pointe North High (GPN) is located in the  city of Grosse Pointe Woods, approximately two miles from BGP, and Lake Shore  High (LSH) is in Saint Clair Shores, approximately nine miles from BGP. LSH  also has a cooperative arrangement with Roseville Public School that allows  students from Roseville High School to attend LSH&rsquo;s Health Occupations Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  purpose of the collaboration with the high schools is to give students the  opportunity to observe the many different areas within nursing and the  hospital/healthcare setting, thus broadening their knowledge of the various  roles and specialties that are available in nursing and other areas of  healthcare to increase their interest in nursing careers. BGP&rsquo;s objective in  coordinating with the community high schools is to promote the nursing  profession so that students who complete their nursing degree will choose to  work at BGP. Although the focus is nursing, the students are also introduced to  entry level employment opportunities as, for example, nursing care assistants,  clinical assistants and transportation personnel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Participation  by Community Members</strong><br>
  For  the past four years, Debra Briske, MSN-Ed, RN, CEN has coordinated the  community partnership between BGP and the two high schools. GPN&rsquo;s Applied  Medical Research Course and LSH&rsquo;s Health Occupations Course are recognized  programs for which participants receive college credit in addition to their  high school credit. Although both courses concentrate on healthcare careers in  general, the observation at BGP focuses on nursing careers. When students  observe an ancillary discipline, the experience is then discussed in terms of  how that department interacts with and supports nursing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students  must pass prerequisite high school courses prior to enrolling in the BGP  observation. In addition, the students must have an interest in enrolling in  higher education that is nursing or healthcare-based. Students must comply with  health regulations, so they are instructed on HIPAA regulations, standard  precautions, handwashing and patient confidentiality. The students are also  required to be current with their immunizations and TB testing, and they must  obtain parental consent on the work agreement to attend the BGP observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong> <br>
  In  preparation for the start of the fall semester, Briske contacts the GPN and LSH  instructors to ensure that the observation is on the agenda and to find out the  number of students that each school has in the program.  Once that is established, an email is sent to BGP department leaders  requesting their continued support in participating with student observations  and asking those who have not previously participated to consider doing so. To  ensure that the students have a well-rounded nursing experience, the following  nursing departments are contacted: Pre-op, Post-op, Endoscopy, Critical Care,  2NE – Critical Care Step Down, 2SE – Stroke/Hospice, 3SE – Orthopedic, 3W –  GI/Surgical, Emergency Center, Dialysis, Interventional Heart and Vascular, Anesthesia  and Infusion Services. The students are also given the opportunity to observe  in the Radiology, Laboratory, Transportation and Biomedical Engineering  departments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP  leaders and caregivers are involved with and supportive of students, and they readily  share their knowledge and resources. A department or nursing unit will occasionally  decline to host the high school students due to construction in their  department, new hires who are in orientation or possibly new leadership in the  department, but as soon as they are able to accommodate the students again the  leader will rejoin. All leaders are asked to complete a grid stating whether  their department/unit will participate (Y/N) along with dates/times and contact  information.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE5-1.pdf">(Evidence  SE5-1, High School Observation Grid at BGP Email and Observation Grid)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once  the leaders have completed the information on the grid, Briske compiles the  observation rotation information into a user friendly table for the schools to  use when scheduling the student observations. The rotation table gives  information regarding unit, contact person, contact information (phone number  and email), day and time availability and other special requests (e.g.,  observation will have two students in each area unless otherwise noted). <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE5-2.pdf">(Evidence SE5-2, GPN and LSH High School Observation  Rotation 2015-2016)</a>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before  the start of the high school observations, students attend an orientation at  BGP that includes didactic presentations on handwashing, BGP  standards/professionalism, work/observer agreement, confidentiality, a tour of  the hospital and confirming that vaccines are current and that forms are  signed. Part of the orientation is dedicated to answering students&rsquo; questions  and clarifying BGP&rsquo;s expectations of the observing high school student. It is  stressed that this is mostly a nursing experience with the goal of increasing  the nursing pool at BGP.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE5-3.pdf">(Evidence SE5-3, High School Observation Orientation Agenda)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  week before the start of student observations at BGP, instructors from GPN and  LSH send to all leaders the schedule showing the date and time that students  are assigned to the units so the leaders can prepare. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE5-4.pdf">(Evidence SE5-4, Clinical Rotation Schedule)</a> The  nursing units typically have the students shadow a registered nurse who is able  to explain the particulars of the nurse role in that department/unit and the  type of patients who are seen. For example, Annette Gipprich, RN, clinical  nurse on 2SE, takes great pride in being a nurse at BGP and shares her  enthusiasm with the high school students when they observe on her unit.  Departments such as Laboratory and Biomedical Engineering have interactive  stations set up and/or provide tours of different job responsibilities to  enhance the students&rsquo; learning experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  2015, 14 LSH students and 49 GPN students participated in the clinical  observations at BGP, and over the past four years a total of 228 high school  students have participated. The expectation for taking this course and participating  in the observation experience is that the students intend to pursue a career in  nursing and a degree in healthcare. Of the students who have participated,  approximately 90% have been accepted into a healthcare degree program. Approximately  60% of these pursue a nursing degree, while the rest pursue physical therapy,  respiratory therapy, occupational therapy or medical school. Approximately 75%  of those who enroll in a nursing program complete the degree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
  BGP  often receives cards from individual students demonstrating their appreciation  for the experience. Cards or emails may be sent to a particular department/unit,  or they may be a global thank you to the hospital as evidenced by emails sent  to Briske. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE5-5.pdf">(Evidence SE5-5,  Thank You Notes)</a> It has been challenging to obtain evaluation data from  the schools for various reasons, including student confidentiality and the lack  of formal follow-up.  </p>
