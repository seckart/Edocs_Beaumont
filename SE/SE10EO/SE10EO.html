<p><strong>Beaumont  Nurses Partner with the Community to Increase Awareness of Breast Cancer in the  Grosse Pointes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  According to the Michigan Department of Community  Health (MDCH), cancer is the second leading cause of death in the state of  Michigan, contributing to significant economic and social cost. Uninsured  patients and those from ethnic minorities are more likely to be diagnosed with  cancer at a later stage, when treatment is more extensive, debilitating and  costly.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of Michigan cancer programs is to enhance  initiatives, capacity and infrastructures toward the reduction of cancer  morbidity and mortality and related health disparities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1991, the MDCH implemented a statewide breast and  cervical cancer control program. Low income women should have access to lifesaving  breast and cervical cancer screening services such as consults and follow-up  care, including treatment if necessary.     </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the Community Assessment Report and a  review of the data on the incidence of breast cancer in Michigan, Phyllis  Reynolds, MSN, RN, Beaumont Grosse Point (BGP) Vice President and Chief Nursing  Officer at the time, and Deborah Kleinhomer, MSN, RN, Administrative Director,  BGP, determined that the communities BGP serves had higher rates of breast cancer  diagnosis and death than the state of Michigan and the nation. The following  are the 2013 rates of breast cancer in Wayne County the state of Michigan and  the nation:</p>

<p align="center">SE10, Breast Cancer Incidence in  Nation, State and County</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wayne County is home to two different populations:  Detroit is a poor, primarily minority community, and Grosse Pointe is more  affluent. Some researchers have speculated that the breast cancer rate is  higher in the Grosse Pointes due to all the pesticides used to maintain the  lawns and gardens of homes in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the higher than average breast cancer rate in  BGP&rsquo;s service area, it wanted to partner with the community to increase the  number of women who are consulted and screened at the Comprehensive Breast Care  Center. The goal was to increase the number of consults because early diagnosis  improves outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reynolds, Kleinhomer and Robert Kilpatrick, BSRS,  RTR, Administrative Director, BGP, were charged with improving the breast care area  in the Radiology Department. The goal was to develop a Breast Care Center that  is in the Radiology Department, but separate, to maintain the privacy of  patients who are experiencing a life changing event.</p>
<p> <br>
  Reynolds and  Kleinhomer met with Suzy Berschback, Community Relations Manager for BGP, to  discuss their concern and inquire how BGP could partner with the community to  improve breast cancer screening for the community. Berschback suggested they attend  a meeting of Beaumont Community Health Alliance, which is a  group of 30 community members representing various aspects of the community. Members  include representatives from Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Neighborhood Club, Grosse  Pointe Chamber of Commerce, Grosse Pointe Public Schools, Harper Woods Public  Schools, American Cancer Society and various other community groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third  quarter 2013, Reynolds and Kleinhomer met with the Health Alliance to discuss  the proposed Breast Care Center and the goal of increased breast cancer awareness  and the need for increased screening. After the presentation, the group agreed  that this would be a good project.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Berschback  arranged a focus group to solicit ideas about what an ideal Breast Care Center  would look like. The focus group members were chosen based on their prominence  in the Grosse Pointe community and their desire to partner with BGP to provide  state of the art breast care to the women of the Grosse Pointes and surrounding  area. The following community members were asked to sit on the focus group:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mrs. Christopher J. Blake </li>
  <li>Mrs. Libby Candler </li>
  <li>Mrs. Hadley French </li>
  <li>Mrs. Richard Platt </li>
  <li>Mrs. Sheila Crandall </li>
  <li>Mrs. Susan Kraft </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus group was facilitated by Kilpatrick  and Reynolds. A key strategy identified by the focus group was the need for BGP  to hire a nurse who would assist women who come in for diagnostic testing. They  believed this nurse would help women navigate the Beaumont systems and help  ensure the next steps are followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth quarter 2013, Bernadine Sherwood, MHSA,  BSN, RN, ONC, CBCN, Nurse Navigator, and Mary Smith, BSN, RN, Breast Radiology  Nurse, were hired to improve the care of breast cancer patients. A key strategy identified by Sherwood to improve  this care was to increase the number of consults to the Breast Care Center to  promote early diagnosis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ad hoc Comprehensive Breast Care Committee was  formed to develop and improve the Breast Care Center at BGP.  The committee&rsquo;s first goal was to improve  care, market the importance of breast exams and consults, and make adjustments  to the services after the Breast Care Center opened.  </p>
<p>In fourth quarter 2013, there were 60 breast care consults  at the Breast Care Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To increase the number of breast care consults to  the Comprehensive Breast Care Center at Beaumont Grosse Pointe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities </strong><br>
  <em>January 2014 </em><br>
  Sherwood participated in the following activities to  increase awareness of early diagnosis leading to better outcomes:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sherwood worked with Chandler Park Academy - Harper  Woods Health Fair, held at a local high school. The goal was to increase high  school students and parents&rsquo; awareness of the importance of breast health and  stress the importance of early diagnostic testing.</li>
  <li>Sherwood held a Breast Center Open House on Sundays  following the Catholic Mass in the Hospital Chapel. Tours of the breast Care  Center were given and its services explained to educate the public on breast  cancer. This event was held in conjunction with church services since many  community members attend Catholic Mass at BGP.</li>
  <li>Sherwood also visited physician offices and clinics  to market the Breast Care Center to doctors and their staffs. The goal was to  increase community awareness of breast health.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February 2014</em><br>
  The official ribbon cutting ceremony for the Breast  Care Center was held, with Jennifer Boettcher, Director, Grosse Pointe Chamber  of Commerce, to market its services to the community. Boettcher stressed the  importance of the community partnering with BGP nurses to address a healthcare  need. The Breast Care Center was now a dedicated area, rather than just a  sub-department in Radiology. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March 2014</em><br>
  BGP&rsquo;s Community Relations Department offered a  community education series at the Grosse Pointe War Memorial to promote women&rsquo;s  health. One of the workshop lectures, &ldquo;No Excuses,&rdquo; stressed that there was no  excuse to not have a breast exam. Sherwood was present and distributed to all  attendees information about the services offered at the new center.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>April 2014</em><br>
  &ldquo;Sharing and Caring Education&rdquo; night was held in the  Connelly Auditorium, with the lecture provided by Adli Yakan, MD, Chief Medical  Oncology. The Breast Care Center is adjacent to the Connelly Auditorium, so Sherwood  offered tours after the lecture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2014</em><br>
  Sherwood and Smith attended a Breast Care Center  focus group consisting of patients who had been to the center in the first  three months after its opening. The purpose of the focus group was to partner  with the community and current patients to develop ways to improve the center. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following suggestions were implemented based on  the feedback from the focus group participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For more privacy a door was added from the changing  room to the hallway so patients would no longer need to pass through the gowned  waiting area to enter and exit.</li>
  <li>A private exit was added from the suite to the  outside for patients who are distressed.</li>
  <li>For added privacy the stereotactic exam rooms were  relocated from the front of the suite to the back of the suite.</li>
  <li>For added comfort the hospital gown was changed at  both the hospital and in Beaumont Health System.</li>
  <li>Care will be provided with all caregivers stressing  personalized conservation, support and guidance.</li>
  <li>The Breast Care Center nursing staff will provide  courtesy calls, assist with scheduling, facilitate callback appointments and  help expedite follow-up with the breast care surgeon within 7-10 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2014</em><br>
  BGP sponsored the Beaumont Golf Outing to benefit  the Beaumont Grosse Pointe Comprehensive Breast Care Center. Sherwood was at  the event, which was held at the Country Club of Detroit. More than 100 hospital  and community members participated in the event, which raised over $80,000 for  the BGP Comprehensive Breast Care Center.</p>
