<h2>Care Delivery System(s) EP5</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Nurses  are involved in interprofessional collaborative practice within the care  delivery system to ensure care coordination and continuity of care.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide two examples,  with supporting evidence, of nurses' involvement in interprofessional  collaborative practice that ensures care coordination and continuity of patient  care.</em></p>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: Nurse  Navigator for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary  Disease (COPD) Population</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johanna Castronero, BSN, RN, Nurse  Navigator (NN) holds the position that is used within Beaumont Health and  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) to provide education to patients and their families  about disease process and management of CHF and COPD.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5- 1.pdf">(Evidence  EP5-1 Job Description of Nurse Navigator)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interprofessional  Collaborative Practice</strong><br>
  The Nurse Navigator follows patients  from admission to post discharge in an effort to continue and reinforce  teaching efforts and to ensure care coordination and continuity of patient care  once the patient is discharged from BGP. The Navigator also collaborates with  other disciplines, including In-patient nursing, care management, physicians  and home care to ensure the patient and families have their healthcare needs  met at the time of discharge.  The Navigator  also assists the patients and families with care choices for continued care in  the out-patient setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHF and COPD are chronic diseases that  become progressively worse over time. <br>
  Heart failure is a progressive  condition, beginning with predisposing factors and leading to the development  and worsening of clinical illness. The need for hospitalization is an important  marker for poor prognosis. </p>
<p>Chronic  bronchitis is 1 of the 2 main types of a serious lung disease called  &quot;COPD.&quot; The other main form of COPD is called &quot;emphysema.&quot;  COPD can make it hard to breathe. Both types of COPD are often caused by  smoking. Both conditions have been identified as the underlying cause for  hospital admissions and readmissions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont  Grosse Pointe offers a disease specific Nurse Navigator to assist patients and  their families to gain understanding of the disease process and management. The  Navigator works to provide consistent education to the CHF and COPD patients. Education  may include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disease  management</li>
  <li>Nutrition  information </li>
  <li>Post  discharge follow-up</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-2.pdf">(Evidence EP5-2 Note from Electronic Medical Record)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Care Coordination and  Continuity of Care</strong><br>
  Castronero,  Nurse Navigator, coordinates patient care with the clinical nurse, care managers,  medical staff and home care.   She works  to educate patients and their families while they are in the hospital as well  as post hospitalization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  CHF and COPD patients are provided with a direct phone line to the Nurse  Navigator. Patients and families are able to contact the Navigator with any  questions they have while in the hospital or post discharge. Castronero  provides patient and family centered education based on her assessment of the  patients&rsquo; needs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  education tools for the CHF patients include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A  CHF calendar</li>
  <li>What  is heart failure </li>
  <li>CHF  action plan/CHF checklist</li>
  <li>Heart  failure maintenance guidelines</li>
  <li>Why  should I limit sodium </li>
  <li>Sodium  tracker and understanding nutrition labels. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  education tools for the COPD patients include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lung  conditions packet which includes disease process and treatments, diet,  medications and follow up care.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>COPD  action plan and COPD checklist.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-3.pdf">(Evidence EP5-3 Education tools for CHF and COPD  Patients)</a><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the patient does not  have a primary care physician, Castronero assists the patient with obtaining a  physician to provide care for them once they are discharged from the  hospital.  She will also assist with post  discharge appointment arrangement as needed. <strong></strong><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Involvement in  Care</strong><br>
  Castronero  begins her day with running reports to find the CHF and COPD patients in the  hospital. Once she has established which patients need to be seen, she  carefully reviews each patients&rsquo; individual charts in EPIC, BGP electronic  medical record. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castronero  will gather patient teaching information for either the CHF or COPD patient.  The Navigator also completes smoking cessation teaching if needed at the time  of the patient assessment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior  to seeing the patient, Castronero will meet with the clinical nurse and  physician to gain information regarding the care of the patient.  She will question the nurse to find out as  much information regarding the patients&rsquo; current status, and prior medical history.  She wants to know whatever the clinical nurse  knows about the patient.  Castronero will  then try to meet with the physician if available to discuss teaching needs of  patients, any information that needs to be reinforced and discharge plans. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Navigator meets with patients and their families to educate them on disease  process and management. If family is not available the Navigator completes  phone interviews. During the interview/assessment process the navigator is  gathering information about the patient&rsquo;s perception and knowledge of COPD or  CHF. She identifies if there are any knowledge deficits and provides education  as needed. She discusses with the patient what support systems the patient has  and if additional support is needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If  patients are well knowledgeable about their disease process, diet and follow up  with care the patient will be informed regarding post discharge follow up  calls.  If the patient needs  reinforcement in their education, Castronero will meet with the patient and  family for further education.  Castronero  will then make contact with care management to assist in the arrangement of  home health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Navigator documents her findings of her assessment in a narrative note in EPIC.  The documentation in Epic allows for all members of the care team to know what  was taught and if there are any issues to be addressed. <br>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-4.pdf">(Evidence EP5-4 Note from Electronic  Medical Record)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Post Discharge Plans</strong><br>
  The  Navigator coordinates with other members of the care team to formulate optimal  discharge plans for patients.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A  post discharge call is placed to COPD and CHF patients that are agreeable. The  post discharge call allows for the reassessment of education provided. It also  provides an opportunity for the Navigator to reinforce teaching, to answer  questions and to provide follow up support/problem solving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When  a COPD or CHF patient readmits to the hospital, the Navigator revisits the patient  to find out why they returned to the hospital: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Was  it disease related</li>
  <li>Was  there a knowledge deficit </li>
  <li>Was  there a lack of support/infrastructure </li>
  <li>When  knowledge deficits are found repeat teaching is completed. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples of discharge plans that  care coordination and continuity of patient care are supported by the nurse  navigator are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms.  H. is a 46 year old COPD patient.  She  lives alone and has a nebulizer. She had regular follow up with her primary  care provider but her pulmonologist retired. Patient was assisted in finding a new  pulmonologist that would provide continuity of care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms.  T is a 56 year old patient with CHF. She lives alone with no durable medical  equipment. Patient had received CHF education. On a routine post discharge  follow up call, the patient was complaining about chest pain. The Navigator  advised patient to return to the ER due to her complaints of having chest pain.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-5.pdf">(Evidence EP5-5 COPD  Physician Referral 2/7, 2/8 &amp; 2/10/17 and CHF post discharge note 1/4/16)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 2: Progressive  Rounds on 3 West to Facilitate Discharges</strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) adopted  discharge planning as a readmission reduction initiative in early 2015.Discharge  planning begins upon admission when patients are screened for discharge needs  and both the patient and family are provided education to prepare them for their journey after  discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 West, a 45 bed Medical-Surgical Unit  with a specialty of Gastrointestinal Surgical patients, realized the need for  improvements in the patient discharge process. To assist in this process a morning  huddle is held at 10:00 am to facilitate smooth communication between Clinical  Nurse and Care Manager (CM). Each Clinical Nurse would review their patient  assignment and update the CM on the nursing care plan and the concerns of the  patient and family. The CM would also relay any issues/concerns in the discharge process from the  insurance or transition prospective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patricia Ackley, BSN, RN Assistant Nurse  Manager usually attends for informational purposes and to support the clinical  nurses and care managers to ensure a safe discharge of the patient. Each case  was discussed in depth as to current status and progression to discharge.  Patients would be updated by  the clinical nurse on the plan of care and status of patient needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical Therapy (PT) plays a vital role  in the assessment of the ambulatory status and recommendation of extended  physical rehabilitation.  PT became a  part of the morning huddle as well. It was found to be very helpful to have  therapy present to be notified in real time of therapy needs so that they could  be addressed quickly and not inhibit discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interprofessional  Group</strong><br>
  During the September 3rd,  2015 meeting of the Discharge Domain Task Force the concept of Progressive Rounds  was introduced. Maria Miller, Controller, BGP and Kristin Cavender, BSIE, MBA,  CSSBB Administrative Director BGP, presented the idea from Diane DiFiore, MHSA,  RN, System Director, Performance Excellence. </p>
<p>The three goals of Progressive Rounds  are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Plan  for discharge</li>
  <li>Determine  what is needed from the Physician for discharge</li>
  <li>Review  outstanding orders from the previous twenty-four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Evidence  EP5-6 Agenda and Minutes from September 3, 2015 Discharge Domain Group) <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to Cavender and Miller, members of  this Task Force for Progressive Rounds included:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Deborah Kline, LMSW,  ACSW, Director of Care Management <br>
    Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RN, NE-BC, Chief Nursing Officer<br>
    Molly Brieden, RN,  Assistant Nurse Manager 3 West<br>
    Patricia Ackley, BSN,  RN Assistant Nurse Manager 3 West<br>
    Mary Catherine Blaine,  Director of Service Excellence<br>
    Holly Cory, RN, CCM,  Care Manager<br>
    Rowena Angeles, RN Care  Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the September 3rd  meeting Brieden mentioned that she saw a video of Progressive Rounds on Youtube  and suggested that all members of the committee review the video and BGP could  use that as a guide for the rounding. (Evidence EP5-7 Email regarding progressive rounding video)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative  Practice</strong><br>
  On September 17, 2015, it was discussed  during the Discharge Domain Task Force meeting that Progressive Rounds were  something BGP would like to proceed with.   A video from Beaumont Dearborn was shown regarding progressive rounds  and it was shared that Beaumont Dearborn has high discharge Press Ganey scores.  Holly Cory, RN, CCM, Care Manager,  agreed to pilot the program on her assigned patients.  (Evidence EP5-8 September 17, 2015 Agenda and Minutes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rollout of the pilot began September  21, 2015 with Cory on her assigned 3 West patients. Cory and the clinical nurse  would enter the patient&rsquo;s room with a computer for reference and Cory would  introduce the care team and write her name on the white board. The expectation  was the clinical nurse would share the nursing Plan of Care, incorporating any  pending tests or pertinent medical information necessary for progression to  discharge. (Evidence EP5-9  Memo, Template and Documentation of Progressive Rounds)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cory would  lead the discussion with the patient and family and then conduct a short  needs-assessment interview to screen for discharge readiness. Part of the  screen would include the patient&rsquo;s ambulatory status as it related to the  patient&rsquo;s physical environment. At this time, the patient was invited to  communicate any concerns about their continuing care at home. Taking into  account the patient&rsquo;s needs and concerns, Cory and the clinical nurse would  formulate an informal discharge plan and communicate this to the patient. This  formulary process would be conducted daily, Monday through Friday at 10:00 am.  The patient was encouraged to invite family or their support person to be  present for these daily progressive discharge rounds. Having support for the  patient would ensure all concerns were addressed for the continuity of care  after discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coordination  and Continuity of Care</strong><br>
  Upon leaving the patient&rsquo;s room, the  care team would informally meet and delegate responsibility for the completion  of discharge tasks. At this point, the pharmacy would be consulted for any  possible discharge medication needs. PT would be notified of a need for an  evaluation/re-evaluation and recommendation of possible patient care needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  order to ensure a smooth transition from the hospital to home and to provide  seamless care, Cory would be the person responsible to ensure that the patient  and family are ready for discharge.  She  would be responsible for ordering equipment, beds, supplies (IV meds, tube  feedings, wound vacs, walkers,) to ensure that family has all the appropriate care to the patient when  they return to their home setting.    It was also the care  managers&rsquo; responsibility to verify benefits for medications, rehab  services and home care. She would also set up discharge transportation,  referrals to Social Work for ECF placement and community resources such as  Meals on Wheels. It was Corys&rsquo;  responsibility to make sure that the patient and family had all the necessary  equipment they would need to provide the required care in the home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nursing would be responsible for the  communication with the physician regarding any verification of orders or  patient/family concerns. Nursing  would also be responsible for any education regarding the care of the patient  for the family.  Education may include  medication, equipment or signs and symptoms to monitor.  The Respiratory Department would be consulted  if there were any respiratory needs post-discharge. Spiritual care would be  advised of a patient request to be visited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inpatient Nursing was the impetus for  the change in our discharge planning and communication process. As the planning  progressed, it was apparent that this process would be most successful if every  discipline was involved as a collaborative effort. In our pursuit of excellent  patient care, we continue to monitor our patient&rsquo;s perception of discharge  preparedness through our Press Ganey Discharge Domain Scores. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process was so successful that the  process began with the other care manager, Angeles.  (Evidence EP5-10 October 10, 2015 Discharge Domain Meeting Minutes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>There is evidence  that the new process has made a difference in 3 West discharge information  Press Ganey Scores.  In 2014, the  percentile ranking for the discharge domain at the end of year was 8%, in 2015  the percentile ranking at the end of the year was 9% and in 2016 the percentile  ranking at the end of the year was 26%. </p>
