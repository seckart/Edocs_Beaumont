<p><strong>Beaumont Grosse Pointe Performance Review  Process</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) nurses at all levels are introduced to the evaluation  process by their manager during the initial orientation period. This includes expectations,  timing of evaluations, performance scoring and annual goal setting. Performance  appraisals are completed annually, with the performance evaluation period  coinciding with the calendar year and reflecting a summation of the previous 12  months of performance. The information used in the evaluation includes feedback  from the employee (self), peer(s) and manager. An electronic program, Halogen®,  is used to document the evaluation for registered nurses at all levels. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance  evaluation (self, peer and supervisory evaluation) for nurses other than nursing  leaders, including clinical nurses, Advanced Practice Nurses, Nurse Educators, Care  Managers, specialty nurses and all registered nurses who are not in formal leadership  positions, uses the same electronic evaluation tool, the Employee Appraisal. Nursing  leaders, including the Chief Nursing Officer, Directors, Administrative  Supervisors, Administrative Managers and Associate Nurse Managers, use the  Leadership Appraisal. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-1.pdf">(Evidence EP15-1, Policy 281 Performance Appraisal  Program)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Employee Non-nurse Leader and Nurse Leadership  Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Self-evaluation for All Nurses</strong><br>
  A self-evaluation  for nurses at all levels is completed on the Halogen program using the  following rating scale for each competency:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1  – Fails to Meet (Never or not able to demonstrate competency)</li>
  <li>2  – Developing (Sometimes or usually demonstrates the competency)</li>
  <li>3  – Fully Effective (Consistently demonstrates the competency)</li>
  <li>4  – Commendable (Always demonstrates the competency and sometimes exceeds the  expectations)</li>
  <li>5  – Role Model (Consistently exceeds the expectations)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  the self-evaluation process, the expectation is that nurses will reflect on the  achievement of goals from the previous year&rsquo;s performance evaluation and will  develop personal and professional goals for the coming year. Goals are documented  in the &ldquo;My Performance&rdquo; section of the self-evaluation tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Peer Evaluation for all Nurses </strong> <br>
  Nurses at  all levels are expected to participate in providing feedback about peer performance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer  evaluation at all levels is completed on the Halogen program. The peer  evaluator, using the same rating scale as the one used for the self-evaluation,  rates each competency for which they have knowledge regarding their peer&rsquo;s  performance. Peer review is completed by one to three peers who are selected by  the nurse and the nursing leader. The nurse submits names of peers to their  leader, who then usually selects one from the nurse&rsquo;s list and then another one  or two of the leader&rsquo;s choice to complete the peer review. Nurses who are selected  to complete a peer review are sent an automatic email by Halogen informing them  that they have a peer review to complete. The peer feedback is usually  anonymous. The peer rates the nurse on a scale of one to five on the following  categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quality  and Safety</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Job  Responsibilities/Productivity</li>
    <li>Job  Skills/Competencies</li>
    <li>Reliability</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Service</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Beaumont  Standards</li>
    <li>Employee  Engagement</li>
  </ul>
  <li>People  and Systems</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal/Professional  Development</li>
    <li>Partnerships</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Financial  Performance</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Efficient  Use of Resources/Enhanced Productivity</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Evaluation Tools</strong><br>
  The nurse  leader can also send the evaluation tool through Halogen to other members of  the healthcare team, including internal customers and direct reports of the person  being evaluated. This is not required, but is available as a tool to give the  nurse leader a 360 degree report of the employee. One example of internal customers  being used was in the evaluation of Debra Briske, MSN RN, CEN. Briske is a  Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) who reports directly to Randy Whitney, MSA,  BSN, RN, NE-BC, but is the CNS for the medical/surgical units. Whitney sent the  evaluation tool to a sample of the Administrative Managers of the medical/surgical  units to solicit their input as Briske&rsquo;s internal customers. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-2.pdf">(Evidence EP15-2, Briske 2016 Evaluation)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong><br>
  During  the evaluation time frame, nurses at all levels meet with their immediate supervisor  to discuss their performance and mutually decide on ratings for each competency.  The supervisor gathers feedback from all sources, including the  self-evaluation, peers, internal customers and/or direct reports if applicable,  and the supervisor, to discuss with each nurse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Development Goals </strong> <br>
  During  the evaluation process, the professional goals from the previous year are  reviewed with the nurse and new goals are agreed upon and developed for the coming  evaluation period. These goals are tied to the strategic goals of the  organization and also reflect the personal professional development goals  identified as being important to the clinical nurse or nurse leader. The  Halogen program includes a section for documenting and tracking goals. The  nurse and supervisor both sign off electronically on the Halogen program  appraisal once a consensus is reached. The nurse is allowed to make final  comments on the evaluation process, which is separate from the actual annual  evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Clinical Nurse Evaluation – Self  and Peer  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the  2015 performance appraisal process, S.D., Clinical Nurse II Orthopaedic/Surgery  unit, began by completing a self-evaluation in the &ldquo;Employee&rdquo; section of the  Halogen tool. S.D. gave herself a rating of 3 (fully effective) in the job  skills/competencies section of the evaluation. Peer feedback was incorporated  into the 2015 employee appraisal and was shared with S.D. during the evaluation  with her manager. Comments from her peer included that she had gotten more  comfortable in her role as an RN and that she works very hard to give her  patients great care. Based on the peer feedback and S.D.&rsquo;s self-assessment, a  professional development goal was set to attend a medical/surgical or  orthopedic conference in 2016 to further her professional growth. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-3.pdf">(Evidence EP15-3, 2015 Employee  Appraisal Including Self and Peer)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Development</strong><br>
  S.D. was  again evaluated in 2016. A self-evaluation was completed (highlighted in yellow  in Evidence EP15-4), and a peer review was completed (highlighted in pink). S.D.  met her goal to further her professional growth by attending a national  conference. In April 2016, she attended the National Association of Orthopaedic  Nurses (NANO) Chapter Annual Conference. Peer feedback and her manager comments  demonstrate that S.D. met her goal to continue to develop in her role. Peer  comments included, &ldquo;is a role model in nursing competencies and nursing skills;  she knows how to do almost anything in caring for our patients.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-4.pdf">(Evidence EP15-4, 2016 Employee  Appraisal) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Nurse Leader Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R.W, MSA,  BSN, RN NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice and Magnet Program Director, is  an experienced nurse leader who oversees multiple areas that support nursing,  including education, the nursing business office and the Magnet Program.  R.W.&rsquo;s 2015 performance evaluation began with  a comment from a peer that he is not afraid to say what needs to be said, but  he also knows when to put on the kid gloves. During the evaluation process, R.W.&rsquo;s  supervisor, Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer, discussed how some of the Administrative Managers feel that  when nothing is said, it must mean that the idea is not looked upon favorably. Based  on this feedback, R.W. followed up with Marie Reinman, BSN, RN, Director of Heart  and Vascular and Critical Care Nursing, to seek her feedback. Reinman shared  with R.W. that the Administrative Mangers believe that when he does not give  this opinion on a topic or solution being discussed by the team, it is viewed  as not supporting the idea. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-5.pdf">(Evidence  EP15-5, 2015 Leadership Appraisal)</a>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Development</strong><br>
  Based on  feedback from the 2015 evaluation and follow up discussions with Reinman, R.W. identified  a professional development goal to improve his communication style to minimize  misunderstandings. In 2016, he read articles on communication styles and made a  conscious effort to not remain quiet and to give his opinion on most, if not  all, issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the self-evaluation  section of the 2016 Leadership Appraisal, R.W. stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Based on feedback from  last year&rsquo;s evaluation, I have adjusted my communication style. I try to give  my opinion on everything that is being discussed, so that people do not get the  impression that I do not like the idea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According  to his 2016 evaluation, R.W. adjusted the way he communicates with the  Administrative Managers. The CNO commented that he &ldquo;is open, honest, direct and  thoughtful in his interactions.&rdquo; Peer feedback supported the effectiveness of R.W.  achieving his goal: &ldquo;is an active listener; asks questions and looks for  solutions outside the box.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP15-6.pdf">(Evidence  EP15-6, 2016 Leadership Appraisal)</a></p>
