<h2>Culture of Safety EP18EO</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Workplace  safety for nurses is evaluated and improved.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Provide two examples, with supporting evidence, of improved workplace safety for nurses resulting from the safety strategy of the organization. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data.</em></li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Ekahau Safety System, a Personal Protective Device for Clinical Nurse  Safety</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Workplace safety is always a concern for  clinical nurses. Acts of violence in the workplace, including verbal abuse,  shouting, spitting, biting, hitting and even homicide, have become increasingly  common throughout the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hospitals and other healthcare facilities must  serve a diverse population in a timely and thorough manner. Stressors on  patients such as poor health, loss of income, loss of independence and a new  environment can negatively affect their relationship with healthcare providers.  Episodes of violence in the hospital setting encompass not only threats to  employees, but can involve escalating tensions within a family when making  critical decisions for loved ones. Clinical nurses are usually at the greatest  risk because of their close contact and frequent interactions with patients and  their family members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workplace safety and security is a priority at  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), with the Security Department responsible for implementing  strategies to ensure employees&rsquo; safety. The safety strategies currently in  place at BGP include security at all entrances of the hospital, the hospital  doors being locked after 9 p.m. every night and security rounds on the units  throughout the day and night. Employees are required to wear their  identification badges at all time, and two hospital units, the Family Birth  Center (FBC) and Women&rsquo;s Health Care Unit (WHC), are locked down.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to 2014, the standard protocol for the  clinical nurse when encountering a threatening situation was to call a Code  Strong. This was initiated by dialing 55 on any phone in BGP and relaying to  the operator a Code Strong along with the location. The operator, who was located  on the BGP Royal Oak campus, would announce Code Strong and the location on the  overhead paging system at the BGP campus. Security officers would then report  to the location and assess the situation. There was also an expectation that  any available men working in the area would respond as a precautionary measure.  However, there were many issues with this procedure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There  was a delay in sending the message to the off-site operator at Royal Oak and  having it relayed to BGP. </li>
  <li>The  exact location of the incident could be vague or not communicated clearly because  of stress and/or the need to get the message relayed quickly. This sometimes  resulted in Security and staff members showing up at the wrong location and  then having to find the correct one.</li>
  <li>Having  too many people respond could actually aggravate a situation rather than  resolve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  afternoon of March 30, 2014, provided an example of a failure to quickly and  efficiently ensure workplace safety. Erin Savinov, BSN, RN, 3 West clinical nurse,  was assigned as the primary care nurse for a patient in room 358A. 3 West is a 49-bed medical/surgical unit that sees  medical patients as well as all GI and general surgeries.  The unit is fairly large and is divided into  two separate areas by a hallway<em>. </em>Savinov  was providing care for a patient who became angry and frustrated and removed a  pair of scissors from her uniform pocket. Savinov made several verbal attempts  to reassure the patient and requested the return of her scissors.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jodi  Howell, BSN, RN, 3 West clinical nurse, overheard the discussion as she was walking  by the room and stopped to assist Savinov. The patient, still in control of the  scissors, cut her IV line and NG tube. Attempts by Savinov and Howell to  verbally calm the patient were unsuccessful, and Howell called the charge nurse,  Laureen LoPiccolo, RN, 3 West clinical nurse for assistance. The patient  attempted to close the door to Room 358, with Howell stepping in the doorway to  prevent this. LoPiccolo arrived at the scene and attempted to push the door  open while the patient was exiting, and the patient stabbed LoPiccolo&rsquo;s</a> right forearm with the scissors. At this  point LoPiccolo called a Code Strong, and Security officers David Kelly, Dennis  Burnett and Al Johnson arrived at the unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient began to run, knocking over a mobile  computer and running to the stairwell hallway across from Room 362. Paul Tocco,  BSN, RN, clinical nurse, Critical Care Unit, responded to the overhead page.  After attempts to verbally de-escalate the situation were unsuccessful, the  patient was overpowered by Security in the hallway and handcuffed. The patient  was escorted to an empty private room on 3 West, and the patient&rsquo;s husband was  called to alert him to the situation and room change. Michael Pieh, MD, House Officer,  was notified and arrived to assess the patient with subsequent orders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LoPiccolo was treated in the BGP Emergency Room.  Patricia Matway, BSN, RN, Administrative Supervisor, was notified, along with 3  West Assistant Nurse Managers Patricia Ackley, BSN, RN and Molly Brieden, RN,  and Administrator on Call Christine  Stesney-Ridenour, MBA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient continued to receive care on 3 West  until she was transferred to 3SE on March 31, 2014, where she stayed until her  discharge. 3SE is a 44-bed medical/surgical unit that cares for two different  patient populations, with medical patients in one area and surgical joint and  spine patients in another. This unit typically has a short length of stay  because of its surgical patient population. Security searched this patient&rsquo;s  belongings, and all valuables and sharp items were sent home with her  husband.  Security was required to round  frequently that evening, and a Potential for Violence alert was placed in her  chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one clinical nurse injury caused by a  patient in first quarter 2014, which equates to 0.38 clinical nurse injuries  per 100 clinical nurses. BGP&rsquo;s commitment to providing a safe environment for  clinical nurses led to action being taken to prevent further injuries to  clinical nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the rate of clinical nurse injuries resulting  from patients&rsquo; acts of violence at BGP, defined as the number of clinical nurse  injuries per 100 clinical nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities: </strong><br>
  The safety of clinical nurses and all staff  members is a high priority of Hospital Administration. Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RN, NE-BC Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, was immediately informed of  the injury to LoPiccolo. Stewart and members of Hospital Administration requested  that a team be formed to investigate the situation and determine ways to ensure  the safety of all employees. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>April 1, 2014 and April  17, 2014 </em><br>
  Stewart arranged for debriefing and action  planning sessions with clinical nurses, nursing leadership and key hospital  leaders. The goal of the meeting was to identify solutions to prevent clinical nurses  or other staff members from being harmed by patients. Stewart knew it was important  to hear about the incident from the staff members involved. The sessions were  attended by Christine Stesney-Ridenour, MBA, Vice President and Chief Operating  Officer, and Robert Kilpatrick, BSRS, RTR, Administrative Director, from  Hospital Administration; nursing leaders Ackley and Biden; clinical nurses  LoPiccolo, Howell, Savinov and Tocco; and members of the Security Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the meetings was to hear what  happened from the clinical nurses&rsquo; perspective, solicit input into what went  right and what went wrong, and generate ideas to prevent future incidents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the meetings on April 1 and 17, attendees  discussed a safety system to ensure the safety of the nursing </p>
<p>staff. Chris  Hengstebeck, Director of Security, reviewed the Ekahau Safety System, which  Beaumont Royal Oak and Beaumont Troy already had in place.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nursing leadership developed a three-part  Safety Plan based on the discussion from the meetings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase  the Ekahau Safety System </li>
  <li>Provide  S.A.F.E. classes, which are non-violent crisis interventiontraining, for clinical nurses and nursing care assistants (NCA)</li>
  <li>Institute  a new phone number for Security</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2014</em><br>
  A new Security phone number was activated to  ensure that assistance from Security would arrive to clinical nurses in a  timely manner. It was changed to an in-house number, 3-911, that would be easy  for employees to remember in an emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2014</em><br>
  Although the S.A.F.E. classes had been  available through Beaumont University prior to this incident, they were not  well attended. Nursing leadership determined that all clinical nurses and NCAs  should attend the S.A.F.E. training, so it was made available and nursing  leaders strongly encouraged all clinical nurses to attend.The S.A.F.E program trains workers on verbal intervention  techniques to de-escalate potentially violent situations, along with basic  physical self-defense techniques.  <strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security continues to play a vital role in  workplace safety, as it is responsible for teaching the initial eight-hour  S.A.F.E. class and the two-hour refresher class. Participants are provided  education and engage in role play about handling dangerous situations such as a  patient or family member yelling, pacing, acting agitated or pulling a worker&rsquo;s  hair, and they learn how to get out of a choke hold and various arm holds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>July 2014</em><br>
  Because the seriousness of the event, Stewart  and hospital leadership supported the purchase and implementation of the Ekahau  Safety System for BGP. Although this was a non-budgeted item, the safety of the  staff was the most important concern of Hospital Administration. All bedside  staff members, including clinical nurses, NCAs, nursing leaders and Respiratory  Therapy staff, are required to wear Ekahau badges, which are small GPS devices  that track the wearer wherever they travel in BGP. The badge is activated by  simply pulling it against the lanyard, which will alert Security and other unit  staff. Security and co-workers can then respond quickly to the exact location,  and the clinical assistant can identify the exact location through a desktop  computer program. The clinical assistants function in a dual role, with most of  their day spent at the desk functioning as a unit secretary, although they are  also trained to perform certain nursing care assistant tasks. Clinical nurses are  encouraged to pull the Ekahau badge whenever they feel threatened. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August-September 2014</em><br>
  The Ekahau Safety System was installed at BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>October 2014</em><br>
  Education on the Ekahau Safety System began.  Classes were offered at various days and times during the month, with the  following topics discussed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What  is Ekahau?</li>
  <li>Who  wears the badges?</li>
  <li>Where  will Ekahau be used?</li>
  <li>When  the badges are in use?</li>
  <li>When  the badges are not in use?</li>
  <li>Why  are we doing this?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All  safety strategies to ensure a safer work environment for nurses and all  employees were fully implemented by the end of fourth quarter 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes </strong><br>
  Through BGP&rsquo;s workplace safety  strategies, a  three-part Safety Plan was  developed and implemented. This led to the rate of clinical nurse injuries resulting  from patients&rsquo; acts of violence decreasing from 0.38 per 100 nurses in first quarter  2014 to zero in first, second and third quarter 2015. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><img src="Images/graph1.png" width="760"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Evidence EP18EO-1, Clinical Nurse Injuries from Patient  Violence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There  have been no further injuries from patients since the implementation of the  safety strategies described above. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Providing Clinical Nurses Education to Decrease Needlestick Injuries in  Inpatient Nursing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) supports and promotes a  safe environment for clinical nurses working on the patient care units and  throughout the hospital. One issue that the hospital monitors frequently is the  number of injuries incurred by clinical nurses. The Occupational Health  Department reviews the reports and sends them to the hospital for follow up. These  injuries include needlesticks, strains and sprains, blood and body fluid  splashes, and falls. As clinical nurses can sustain needlestick injuries in  many different ways, BGP promotes a safe environment and provides a number of  measures to prevent them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2016, Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA,  Hospital President, distributed a report during an administrative team meeting outlining  the number and cost of employee injuries at BGP. The cost of injuries was on  the rise, and the project to address this was assigned to Robert Kilpatrick,  BSRS, RTR, Administrative Director.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kilpatrick convened a meeting with representatives  from inpatient nursing, Surgical Services and the Emergency Center. The group&rsquo;s  purpose was to discuss staff injuries and develop a plan to decrease their  number. Its first meeting, on January 27, 2016, was attended by Kilpatrick;  Sandy Rizzo, MSN, RN, CEN Clinical Nurse Specialist, Emergency Center; Ruth  Pinto, BSN, RN, Education Specialist, Surgical Services; and Randy Whitney,  MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice. The group reviewed the  employee injury data and quickly identified the three injuries that were most  prevalent at BGP: puncture wounds, strains and sprains, and exposure to body  fluid.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A review of the data demonstrated that most of the  puncture wounds were caused by needlesticks on the inpatient units. Rizzo  suggested that this data was older and that these injuries might be isolated to  one area. She therefore recommended that the group review additional data to  determine whether there was a trend that needed to be addressed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group continued to monitor the injuries to  nurses, with data showing 0.76 needlestick injuries per 100 clinical nurses in  January 2016 and an increase to 1.15 per 100 clinical nurses in February 2016. It  was clear that this was a safety issue for nurses and that workplace safety  improvements were needed to decrease the rate of needlestick injuries to clinical  nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement:</strong><br>
  To decrease the rate of needlestick injuries to clinical  nurses, as measured by the number of needlestick injuries per 100 clinical  nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>March 2016</em><br>
  Whitney met with nursing education staff to discuss  the number of needlestick injuries at BGP, and Deb Briske, MSN, RN, CEN,  Clinical Nurse Specialist, asked whether BGP had up-to-date products that  prevent puncture injuries. Briske said there are products on the market to  prevent puncture injuries and that an inventory should be taken to determine  whether BGP had all the available products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney spoke with Cindy Harrison, Manager of  Inventory Control, to inquire about safety needle products. Harrison, who is  responsible for the inventory control at BGP, assured him that BGP had all the  available products for preventing puncture injuries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Angela Falzarano, MSN, RN-BC, Clinical Nurse  Specialist, had said during the discussion that Beaumont Troy had an issue with  puncture injuries a couple of years previously. The Education Department had  therefore developed an education program for clinical nurses, which decreased  the number of needlestick injuries at Beaumont Troy. Falzarano suggested that  Whitney contact Andrea Carr, DNP, MSN, MSA, RN, CCRN, Director of Education at  Beaumont Troy, to ask whether BGP could use the program that Carr had developed  for Beaumont Troy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>April 2016</em><br>
  Whitney reviewed the comprehensive Sharps Safety education  module that Beaumont Troy had developedin  January 2015 and asked Carr for permission to use it.  Permission was granted, and it was decided  that BGP would provide education sessions for clinical nurses in June.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2016</em><br>
  Once Carr&rsquo;s approval was obtained, Briske and  Falzarano modified the program and developed the education for the June  sessions. Briske and Falzarano also taught the education sessions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2016</em><br>
  Eight education sessions were provided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thursday June 9, 2016, 1230 to 1530</li>
  <li>Friday June 17, 2016, 1030 to 1330</li>

  <li>Thursday June 23, 2016, 1230 to 1530</li>
  <li>Thursday June 23, 2016, 1545 to 1845</li>
  <li>Friday June 24, 2016, 0900 to 1200</li>
  <li>Tuesday June 28, 2016, 1330 to 1630</li>
  <li>Wednesday June 29, 2016, 1100 to 1400</li>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  As a result of BGP&rsquo;s safety strategies, the  Needlestick Injury Reduction Committee implemented interventions from March  2016 to June 2016 to improve workplace safety for nurses. This led to the clinical  nurse needlestick injury rate decreasing from 1.15 injuries per 100 clinical  nurse in February 2016 to 0.00 in July 2016, 0.74 in August 2016 and 0.00 in September  2016. <strong></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Needlestick Injury Reduction Committee was  disbanded as a result of its great success, although the injury reports are  still shared with its members so they can monitor for any increase in the  number of needlesticks in the hospital. Kilpatrick also shares these reports  with the hospital administrative team. </p>
