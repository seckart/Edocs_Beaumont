<p><strong><em>Nurses  systematically evaluate professional organizations' standards of practice,  incorporating them into the organization's professional practice model and care  delivery system.</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing Blood Draws from Central Lines in  the Critical Care Unit to Decrease Bloodstream Infection Rates</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients with central lines are at an increased risk for  central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), which are costly to  the patient physically and to the organization financially. In August 2015, Critical  Care Unit (CCU) clinical nurses Meredith Janas, RN and Mary Kuznia, RN, CCRN, and  Administrative Manager Kelly Adams, MSN, RN reviewed the NDNQI data on CLABSIs  and noted that the CCU was above the benchmark. The rate had been higher than  expected for a CCU for the previous three quarters, ranging from 5.59 per 1,000  central line days in fourth quarter 2014 to 2.82 in second quarter 2015,  compared to the NDNQI average mean of 0.94.  CCU nurses  determined that the CLABSI rate was unacceptably high, so several practice  changes were implemented to lower this rate in the CCU.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May  2015, the Assistant Nurse Managers and Janet Hamlin, MS Ed, RN, Administrative  Manager, discussed the possibility of using extended dwell catheters as an  alternative to peripherally inserted catheters and/or central venous catheters.  The literature supported the use of extended dwell catheters to decrease  infection rates, and the Assistant Nurse Managers supported this change. Prior  to this time, extended dwell catheters had not been used at Beaumont Grosse Pointe  (BGP). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May  2015, a representative from Bardbegan educating the Intravenous Team on the use  of extended dwell catheters. In June 2015, education was provided to clinical  nurses on the care and management of extended dwell catheters, and a policy  regarding extended dwell catheters was provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use  of extended dwell catheters slightly decreased the CLABSI rate in the CCU, but  it was still above the national benchmark. For third quarter 2015, the CCU&rsquo;s CLABSI  rate was 2.06. The CCU nurses were determined to continue their efforts to  decrease this.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the CLABSI rate in the Critical Care  Unit.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  In fourth  quarter 2015, Gael Rodgers, BSN, RN, Infection Control Practitioner,    reviewed the Infusion Nurses Society (INS)  Standards of Practice. Standard 9 states, &ldquo;The nurse implements infection  prevention measures with the goal of preventing all infusion related and  vascular access device related infections.&rdquo; In addition, the INS Journal of  Infusion Nursing Standard 57.1 states, &ldquo;Blood sampling for laboratory testing  from a central venous access device (CVAD) should be considered based on an  evaluation of benefits versus risks. Risks include occlusion and catheter  related bloodstream infection due to increased hub manipulation.&rdquo;   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rodgers  determined that these standards were consistent with what BGP needed to do to  positively impact the incidence of CLABSIs in the CCU. The review of INS  standards and the CCU&rsquo;s CLABSI data, along with a continued focus on the Professional  Practice Model that keeps the patient at the center of everything that is done  at BGP, made it evident that a change in practice was necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>January  2016:<br>
  Angela  Falzarano, MSN, RN-BC, a Clinical Nurse Specialist new to BGP, questioned why  routine blood work was being drawn from central lines in the CCU. Falzarano  spoke with Rodgers about the INS standard of limiting blood draws from central  lines and decided to discuss the issue with Kelly Adams, MSN, RN, Administrative  Manager of the CCU. Falzarano discussed with Adams her suggestion of eliminating  blood draws from the central lines based on INS Standard 57.1. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recommended  change in nursing practice was presented to Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC,  Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, who was fully supportive. Because  this was a major change in practice based on the INS standards, Stewart  recommended that the medical staff be included in the discussions. Stewart  suggested that drawing from a central line is easier for nurses and more  comfortable for patients, so she believed that the medical staff should be made  aware in case patients discussed the change with their physician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>February  2016:<br>
  Stewart  and Janet Hamlin, MA, BSN, RN, Administrative Manager for  the Internal Resource Team and Nursing Business Office, presented the proposal  for the change in practice at the Physician Chief Meeting. Nicholas Gilpin, DO,  Medical Director Infection Control and Epidemiology, was aware of the INS  standards and strongly supported the change, as did Donna Hoban, MD Physician  in Chief. The plan was approved to move forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William  Hanna, MD and Robert Marchese, MD, physicians with the CCU, were made aware of  the changes and supported the idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March  2016:<br>
  On March  4, 2016, Stewart, Rodgers, Adams, Falzarano and Deb Schroeder, BSN, CGRN,  Education Specialist, met to finalize the details of creating an education plan  for clinical nurses to roll out the change in practice (no blood draw from  central line initiative). They decided to provide unit-based in-services at  change of shift for the first two weeks of March, with the plan of implementing  this practice change on March 15, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the  first two weeks of March 2016, the CCU clinical nurses were provided unit-based  education on a newly drafted policy that identified the practice change of  nurses not using central lines for routine blood draws. The new practice for  the clinical nurses was to obtain blood for laboratory testing by calling  Phlebotomy to do a peripheral stick. This practice change was at first difficult  for the clinical nurses to understand because it was more efficient to draw  from the central line, but once they realized that this is a best practice they  recognized the need. If deemed necessary, a one-time order from the physician  would allow for a central line blood draw.  <br>
  <br>
  On March  14, 2016, a weekly flyer outlining the new practice was distributed to the CCU  staff.<br>
  <br>
  On March  15, 2016, the newly introduced policy regarding blood draws from central lines  went into effect. On March 15 the education was also reinforced through an  educational flyer posted in the CCU.  </p>
