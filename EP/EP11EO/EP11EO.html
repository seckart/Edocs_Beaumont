<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Decreasing the Clinical Nurse Turnover Rate on the Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Unit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2014, Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) had a  seven-bed Pediatric Unit, 3 West, that was  staffed by pediatric nurses and had a dedicated nurse leader. The Pediatric Unit  was experiencing a lower than expected census and, in the latter part of 2014,  its bed capacity was decreased from seven beds to four.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The medical/surgical census continued to increase in  the hospital, so Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer, opened new beds to support the increased medical/surgical  census by increasing its capacity. The census continued to be under budget on  the Pediatric Unit, with most days of the week in first quarter 2015 having  zero pediatric patients on the unit<em>. </em>As the Pediatric Unit was losing money, it was decided  to close the unit on 3 West, move pediatric patients to the Women&rsquo;s Health Unit  on the 4th floor and convert the beds on 3 West into  medical/surgical beds.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Unit (WHU) on the 4th  floor was staffed by nurses from the Family Birth Center (FBC) and would only  admit uncomplicated women&rsquo;s surgeries such as  hysterectomies. The WHU was underutilized, so at the end of first quarter 2015  it was decided to move the pediatric population to the 4th floor and  combine it with the FBC. This new 11-bed unit, called the Women&rsquo;s and  Children&rsquo;s (W&amp;C) Unit, would take care of both pediatric patients and women  with an uncomplicated medical/surgical diagnosis.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2015, Family Birth Center nurse leaders Patricia  Heitz, RNC-OB, C-EFM and Janice Davis, BSN, RNC-OB, C-EFM assumed  responsibility for the W&amp;C Unit as Assistant  Nurse Managers of both the Family Birth Center and the W&amp;C Unit </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heitz and Davis decided that the W&amp;C Unit would be  integrated into the FBC, with staff members attending the FBC staff meetings  and Unit Practice Council (UPC) meetings. (The UPC is the unit&rsquo;s shared governance  body, facilitated by its clinical nurses.) However, this left the W&amp;C Unit  with no individual identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pediatric census never increased, so it was  decided in September/October 2015 that the W&amp;C Unit would no longer take  pediatric patients under the age of 12. This further isolated the pediatric nurses, and nurses began to leave the unit because of  this decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The W&amp;C Unit turnover rate was 18.2% in November  2015 and 9.1% in December 2015. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the clinical nurse turnover rate on thWomen&rsquo;s  and Children&rsquo;s Unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities </strong> <br>
  January 2016:<br>
  Heitz, Davis and Marisa Engel, MSN RNC-OB, C-EFM,  Clinical Nurse Specialist, discussed the turnover on the W&amp;C Unit and recognized  that something needed to be done. They began  discussing with W&amp;C clinical nurses ways to retain staff members, and April  Wynsma, RN clinical nurse, expressed her opinion that the W&amp;C Unit had no individual  identity as a unit. Wynsma suggested that it become its &ldquo;own&rdquo; unit and function  independently of the Family Birth Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>February 2016:<br>
  On February 8, 2016, Engel discussed the issue with  Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Professional Practice Director, who was  supportive of any efforts Engel could make to address the situation. Based on Wynsma&rsquo;s  earlier comments, Engel spoke with her about starting a W&amp;C-specific UPC.  Wynsma was excited about the possibility of having a UPC, believing that a  separate one would help distinguish the unit as its &ldquo;own&rdquo; and that this would  assist with clinical nurse retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 2016:<br>
  The W&amp;C Unit held its first UPC meeting on March  8, 2016, attended by clinical nurses Wynsma; Shirley Stier, RN, CPN; Adebukola  Moshood, RN; Heitz; and Engel. Wynsma was elected to serve as chair of the UPC  and represent the unit on the hospital Professional Nurse Council. The  following items were addressed at the first meeting of the W&amp;C UPC:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Participation in the hospital Professional Nurse  Council</li>
  <li>Meeting days and times</li>
  <li>Membership</li>
  <li>Development of a W&amp;C Unit poster for Nurses Week </li>
  <li>Having medication available on the W&amp;C Unit instead  of having to go to FBC to get floor-stocked medications</li>
  <li>Communication with FBC</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wynsma believed that giving the W&amp;C Unit its own  identity would assist in retaining the current staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2016: </p>
<ul>
  <li>On April 6, 2016, Wynsma attended the Hospital Professional  Nurse Council (PNC) and presented a brief overview of the W&amp;C Unit. She  stressed the importance of separating the FBC from the W&amp;C Unit, whichwould  now have its own clinical nurse on the PNC.  </li>
  <li>On April 21, 2016, the W&amp;C Unit held a second  UPC meeting with Wynsma, Stier, Moshood and Engel present. They discussed W&amp;C  nursing practice issues such as pain documentation, care plan documentation and  patient equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2016: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The third UPC meeting was held on May 17, 2016,  attended by Wynsma, Moshood, Stier, Whitney and Davis. The meeting topics  included:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Magnet®</li>
    <li>The importance of an individual unit identity</li>
    <li>Turnover rates</li>
    <li>The importance of retraining the staff</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>June 2016: <br>
  By June 2016, the UPC was fully operational and  functioning as an independent council. Wynsma and the other clinical nurses  were comfortable in their new roles as UPC members and would seek assistance  from the nurse leaders as needed. The committee participants and structure were  in place, and the UPC began addressing issues that affected the workplace and  empowering the nurses to promote and support their unit. The issues they  addressed included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The staffing plan when the census goes above budget</li>
  <li>Reviewing different staffing models</li>
  <li>Working with the nurse leaders to identify who would  stock the unit</li>
  <li>Assisting with the placement of patients to improve  the flow of the unit</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the issues were addressed, the nurses began to  take ownership of the unit. This has assisted in retaining the nurses on  W&amp;C.  </p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  Clinical nurses&rsquo; involvement in retention activities,  specifically the development of a UPC to provide the nurses with a greater  sense of identity and autonomy, improved the turnover rate on the Women&rsquo;s and  Children&rsquo;s Unit. The clinical nurse turnover rate decreased from 18.2% in November  2015 to 0% in July 2016. </p>
