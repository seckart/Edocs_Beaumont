<p><strong>Improving  the Quality of Care through Nurse-initiated Patient and Family Centered  Interdisciplinary Rounds in the Critical Care Unit </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  supports the inclusion of families as an integral component in the ongoing  effort to provide compassionate, extraordinary care every day. The inclusion of  families, as an extension of the patient, positively impacts the care of the  patient and enhances the relationship between patient and caregiver. This  relationship is enhanced through open communication, which keeps patients and  families better informed of the plan of care and improves teamwork among an  interdisciplinary group of caregivers. The overt, intentional transition to a  more formalized Patient and Family Centered approach to care is consistent with  the efforts of inpatient nursing at BGP to be more inclusive of families and  loved ones as an essential part of that care. Patient and family centered  rounds in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) are one example of this effort to  provide extraordinary care at BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative  Interprofessional Activity</strong><br>
  Prior to February 2016, patient  rounds in the CCU were conducted at a stationary, central location at the  nurse&rsquo;s station. Rounds were conducted there to include a variety of caregivers,  including the intensivist; the clinical nurse caring for the patient; Kelly  Adams, MSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager (ANM); a representative from Physical  Therapy, Pharmacy and Spiritual Care; Gael Rodgers, BSN, RN, Epidemiology; and  Ed Neumier, RN, Palliative Care. Physicians document patient rounds in the  Progress Notes of the electronic medical record (EMR). <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP12-1.pdf">(Evidence  EP12-1, Electronic Medical Record Documentation of Interdisciplinary Rounds)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rounds began at varying times between  0730 and1000, depending on the rounding physician&rsquo;s preference. The early  timing of rounds often frustrated nurses, who had the challenge of presenting a  comprehensive view of the patient without first having an opportunity to fully  assess the patient at the beginning of their shift. The rounds also required  the RN leave the patient&rsquo;s bedside to wait at the nurse&rsquo;s station for their  turn to discuss their patient&rsquo;s care. The logistics of this process were  frustrating to the nurse when care for the critically patient necessitated  their close proximity to the bedside. In addition, rounds were conducted in an  area that was not easily accessible to families and inaccessible to most  patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse-led  Initiative</strong><br>
  In January 2016, CCU clinical nurse Tony Fazi, RN, approached Adams with  the journal article, Communication in Critical Care:  Family Rounds in the Intensive Care Unit.&rdquo;  After discussing this with clinical nurses Karen Johns, RN and Elizabeth  Handran, RN, Adams decided to support the concept of patient and family  centered rounds. Adams, with the support of the nurses, assumed responsibility for  leading this interprofessional, collaborative initiative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams presented the idea of patient  and family centered rounds to the Critical Care Committee on January 18, 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP12-2.pdf">(Evidence EP12-2, Critical Care  Meeting Minutes)</a> The multidisciplinary Critical Care Committee  meets every other month to discuss issues related to the CCU. The agenda  includes report from the Medical Executive Committee, service, Infection  Control, sepsis data, Respiratory Therapy and any other issues that relate to  the CCU.  </p>

<p align="center">EP12, Critical  Care Committee Membership </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With feedback given by CCU RNs, the committee  discussed the need to change the format of rounds for the benefit of patient  and families and the engagement of intensivists in the CCU. The committee  agreed that rounds should be conducted in the patient&rsquo;s room and involve the  multidisciplinary team, and that a formal invitation should be extended to  families. The committee also agreed that rounds should be performed at a  uniform time daily and should involve moving from room to room in the CCU. The  committee further discussed the most effective way to inform families of this  opportunity to communicate with their loved one&rsquo;s caregivers. Members&rsquo;  suggestions included giving a verbal invitation to rounds, leaving a tent card  on the bedside table and/or posting a sign inside the room. The members agreed  on using signage and decided to defer the verbiage of the notice and format to  the CCU Unit Practice Council (UPC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 9, 2016, Adams drafted a  proposed invitation to families both informing them of the purpose of rounds  and inviting them to attend. Adams presented the draft invitation to the UPC  and asked the members for suggestions. A final draft was agreed upon by the UPC  and presented to Robert Marchese, MD, chairperson of the Critical Care  Committee, for his review and consideration. Adams received Marchese&rsquo;s  suggestions during the meeting and presented them to the UPC members on March  8, 2016 for their final approval. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late March 2016, Adams met with Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, to  discuss the UPC&rsquo;s suggested format for informing families of rounding. Adams decided  to communicate the invitation to families using an 8 ½ X 11 inch wall cling  hung prominently in each patient room. Staff members were also encouraged to  educate families about rounds during admission to the CCU and to extend a daily  verbal invite to families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams led daily efforts to inform  clinical nurses of the proposed change in the process of critical care rounds,  using huddles in the CCU near the end of the midnight shift and the beginning of  the day shift. For two weeks before the initiation of these rounds, the white  board for communication in the report room was used to advertise the planned  initiation of patient and family centered rounds. To prepare staff members and  educate them on this change to rounds, Adams wrote messages on the white board  announcing, for example, the go-live date, the expectation for the midnight  shift to participate in rounds by educating families on the process and the  expectation for the day shift to extend daily invites. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education extended to physicians as  well, as Adams engaged in many conversations with the intensivists to discuss  the timing of rounds, the role of families in the daily rounding and the  advantage of bringing rounds to the bedside. The  clinical nurses held many discussions about the change to the format of rounds,  which allowed them to anticipate issues that might be raised by physicians  (e.g., excessive questions/<br>
  repeated interruptions from  families) and prepare their responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient and family centered rounds  began in the CCU in mid-April 2016. A set time of 1000  was implemented for rounds, which allows RNs to first fully assess their  patients.  The RNs immediately  appreciated this, but some physician participants took issue with it as they  were concerned that their obvious availability  would extend their time in the CCU by increasing the time needed to address  family questions. Their concern was addressed, however, after weeks of rounding  showed increased efficiency in addressing patient/family concerns in a timely  and appropriate manner. Physicians and nurses appreciated the feedback of  families, who could provide information that was not readily available in the  chart, such as whether their loved one took any medicine other than those  prescribed by the doctor. Families appreciated the transparency and were  comforted by the obvious involvement of many people in the care of their loved  one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback from staff and families was  overwhelmingly positive. Families would make comments such as, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss  it [rounds]!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand everything, but it makes me feel better to  listen to you [the interdisciplinary team].&rdquo; The same positivity was expressed  by physicians, nurses and Respiratory Therapy staff at the Critical Care  Committee meeting in May 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP12-3.pdf">(Evidence  EP12-3, Critical Care Committee Meeting Minutes)</a> All those in attendance  agreed that the rounds were productive. RNs were satisfied with the open  communication that families were able to witness and be involved in, and with  the team approach that was apparent in the rounding discussions about patient  care. Physicians were satisfied with the families&rsquo; comfort and apparent  decrease in anxiety. All the team members were able to present a collaborative,  unified approach to the family that represented their efforts and was warmly  received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A formal, written invitation was not  available at the time that patient and family centered rounds were initiated,  so CCU nurses verbally encouraged families daily to attend, making them feel a  welcome part of the team. (The wall cling was not yet available because of the  Marketing Department&rsquo;s overwhelming workload related to the affiliation of  eight hospitals to create Beaumont Health.)Adams also visited patients daily  before the interdisciplinary rounds to inform families of the purpose of  rounds, invite them to attend and reiterate their importance as part of the patient  care team. Nearly 100% of families attend the rounds when they are at the bedside  during the rounding time. Rarely, a loved one who is not related to the patient  will decline the invitation to attend out of respect for the patient&rsquo;s privacy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2016, the invitation to CCU  rounds was made available in each patient room and in the CCU waiting room. The  invitation was posted in a prominent position in each room of the CCU. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP12-4.pdf">(Evidence EP12-4, Wall Cling)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong><br>
  Communication between patients/families  and caregivers has improved as a result of the implementation of patient and  family centered rounds in the CCU, as evidenced by the increase in Press Ganey  scores from 2015 to 2016. Prior to the implementation of patient and family  centered rounds in the CCU, the 2015 Press Ganey scores for communication with  doctors and nurses varied each month. The July 2015 year to date score was 4% for  both communication with nursing and communication with physicians.  The July 2016 year to date score for  communication with nursing is 99%, and for communication with doctors it is  76%. The improved communication scores are a result of the implementation of  patient and family centered rounds. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP12-5.pdf">(Evidence EP12-5, Press Ganey Inpatient Scorecard)</a> These rounds  will continue in the CCU in an ongoing effort to provide compassionate,  extraordinary care every day. </p>
