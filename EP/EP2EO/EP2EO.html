<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implementing the Professional Practice  Model:  Improving HCAHPS Patient  Satisfaction Scores for &ldquo;Communication with Nurses&rdquo; through Bedside Shift  Report Process</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of this change in clinical practice, the  Beaumont Nurse Professional Practice Model (PPM) was the Caring: VIP Model, in  place in 2015-2016. Beaumont Health and Beaumont Grosse Pointe changed the PPM  in January 2017, but this example is based on the 2015-2016 PPM.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Beaumont Nurse Professional Practice Model  illustrates the integration of nursing practice with the mission, vision,  philosophy and values of the Beaumont Health Nurse.  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Beaumont philosophy of nursing and model of care  places the patient at the center of his or her healthcare. The Caring: VIP  Model comprises the concepts of Caring, Vision, Innovation and Professional  Practice.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beaumont  Hospital Professional Practice Model  </strong><br>
  <em>Caring: VIP</em><br>
  Caring is the center of all we do. Caring practice  includes empathy, compassion, diversity, respect and dignity. It is a nurturing  way of relating to another, toward whom one feels a personal sense of commitment  and responsibility. We form relationships and collaborate with patients,  families and colleagues to promote optimal health outcomes in the communities  we serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Vision</em><br>
  As Beaumont Nurses, we continually strive for  nursing excellence. We are empowered through a shared governance model which  promotes leadership at all levels of nursing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Innovation</em><br>
  As Beaumont Nurses, we integrate new knowledge, practice and research into clinical practice and care  delivery. We make visible contributions to the science of nursing through  participating in research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Professional Practice</em><br>
  As Beaumont Nurses, we function within the American  Nurses Association&rsquo;s standards of professional nursing practice. We demonstrate  accountability, autonomy and critical thinking in our nursing practice. Continuous  professional development is recognized as essential to our practice and  supported through education, mentoring and reflective learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  The core of the PPM is the relationships that nurses  develop with patients and their families. These relationships are based on open  and honest communication in which clinical nurses collaborate with patients and  their families to develop a plan of care. At Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), one  of the key opportunities for communication about the patient is during change  of shift. However, the communication was missing a very important member of the  team, the patient. In accord with the Caring section of the PPM, clinical  nurses form relationships and collaborate with patients, families and  colleagues to promote optimal health outcomes. Bringing handoff communication  to the bedside was a way to achieve this, by framing BGP&rsquo;s nursing culture as one  that involves true partnerships with patients and their families.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change of shift handoff at BGP was typically being  done in a conference room where the off-going nurse provided a report about the  patient to the on-coming nurse. This isolated handoff did not allow the voice  of the patient to be heard and was fraught with opportunities for error.  Numerous quality reports were submitted reflecting the problems with this  handoff, as critical information was either left out or reported incorrectly. As  bedside shift report was being introduced at hospitals around the country,  clinical nurses and nursing leadership at BGP decided to adopt this to improve  communication between patients, their families and clinical nurses. Beaumont nurses  continually strive for nursing excellence, and bedside shift report (BSR) had  been proven to be a best practice that BGP needed to adopt to improve the care  and safety of patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2015, the Inpatient HCAHPS patient  satisfaction score for &ldquo;Communication with Nurses&rdquo; was 52%, which represents  the percentile ranking for the question about communication with nurses. While  this score was above 50% percentile ranking, it was below where the department  wanted to be.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BGP PPM stresses that Beaumont nurses are caring  people who treat patients and families with respect, compassion and dignity.  Beaumont nurses also form relationships and collaborate with patients and  families to promote optimal health outcomes.   Communication with patients and families is essential to promote a  caring environment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A review of the literature showed that bedside shift  report is an excellent way to improve communication and collaboration with  patients and families, and to involve patients and families in the care being  provided. The idea of implementing BSR was reviewed, and plans for doing so were  developed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To increase HCAHPS patient satisfaction score for  &ldquo;Communication with Nurses&rdquo; for BGP. The score represents the percentile  ranking as compared to Press Ganey All Hospital Database.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  February 2015–April 2015: In February 2015, bedside  shift report was introduced as a pilot on 3 SouthEast (3SE), a 45-bed  orthopedic/medical/surgical unit. The 3 SouthEast Unit Practice Council (UPC)  is made up of clinical nurses, Julie Lynch, BSN, RN; Lori Leman, RN; Katina Hogan,  RN; Lisa Bliss, RN; and Susan Duggan, RN, who worked with Alexis Rogers, RN,  ONC, Assistant Nurse Manager, to facilitate the change. Beaumont nurses are  empowered through a shared governance model that promotes leadership at all  levels of nursing. The implementation of BSR provided a great opportunity for  clinical nurse leaders to champion a change that would make a significant  impact on the communication and care provided at the bedside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nursing Education Department provided education on  BSR to the 3SE clinical nurses, and the UPC and unit manager rolled it out.  According to the PPM, continuous professional development is recognized as  essential to our practice and is supported through education, mentoring and  reflective learning. The nursing educators&rsquo; assistance with this project was  therefore essential. As with any great idea, there was initially a lot of  interest and excitement from the clinical nurses. Over time, however, the  bedside handoff returned to an introduction of the on-coming nurse at the  bedside with report then moving to the hallway. Once again, the most important  members of the healthcare team, patients and their families, were missing in  the communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2015: The evaluation of<strong> </strong>BSR on 3SE showed  that it had had limited success. However, BGP nursing leadership remained committed  to it. BSR was discussed at the Model of Care meeting on May 4, 2015, and the  group decided that it would be rolled out on all units at the same time. The  group decided on October 12, 2015 as the go-live date for BSR.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>June 2015: BSR was discussed at the June 2015 Professional  Nurse Council (PNC) meeting. Bliss, a clinical nurse from 3SE and member of the  PNC, reviewed 3SE&rsquo;s experience during the BSR pilot, and supporting evidence-based  practice articles were distributed. The PNC was very interested and was  committed to being involved in the BSR rollout at BGP.<strong> </strong><br>
  <br>
  July 2015: The education plan for clinical nurses was  created. The education department, Deb Briske, MSN-Ed, RN,CEN, Clinical Nurse Specialist;  Kelly Adams, MSN, RN, Clinical Nurse Specialist; and Deb Schroeder, BSN, CGRN,  Education Specialist, met with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer to plan the required  education sessions. The plan was to provide the education in August and  September so it would be completed by October.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A countdown to bedside shift report was published to  keep clinical nurses aware that October 12, 2015 was the day that BGP would  convert to BSR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>August/September 2015: August and September 2015  were dedicated to the education rollout for clinical nurses. Megan Burns, BSN,  RN, Critical Care Stepdown Unit clinical nurse and member of the BSR team,  served as an expert during the implementation phase. Burns had had a positive  experience with BSR at another hospital, so she served as an expert support  resource for education and the &ldquo;live&rdquo; rollout. She shared her experiences with  various groups of clinical nurses, including UPCs and the Model of Care  Meeting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2015, as the implementation date approached,  Stewart knew that a solid support plan for the clinical nurses was imperative.  Nursing leadership discussed what the support should look like and how it would  be implemented. The plan was to have a nurse leader on every unit at every  shift change every day for the first six weeks. This meant that every nurse  leader and educator would need to sign up for a number of shift changes,  including rotating to off-shifts and covering the weekend shift changes. This  was done to support clinical nurses in the implementation of BSR.<br>
  <br>
  October 2015: BSR was rolled out on all units and  all shifts at 0700 on October 12, 2015. Nursing leaders were flawless in their commitment  to clinical nurses at all shift changes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to  support and monitor the change, as no shift was uncovered for the six weeks. As  the weeks went by it became clear that leaders could cover more than one unit  and still be effective. The number of leaders needed therefore became fewer,  but there was always nurse leader support at every shift change throughout the  six weeks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>November 2015: On November 25, 2015, the monitoring  of BSR was turned over to the unit leadership and the change in clinical  practice was fully implemented. BSR was now the method of shift handoff at  BGP.  </p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
Clinical nurses successfully changed clinical practice by implementing  the Professional Practice Model. This clinical practice change of implementing  bedside shift report at BGP resulted in an increase in the Inpatient HCAHPS  patient satisfaction percentile ranking for &ldquo;Communication with Nurses.&rdquo; The  percentile ranking increased from 52% in January 2015 to 88% in February 2016, and  it remained above the benchmark in 2016.
