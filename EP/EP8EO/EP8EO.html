</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example:   Internal Expert Leads Improvement Project to Eliminate Hospital-acquired  Nasal Pressure Ulcers</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  The mission of Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is to  provide compassionate, extraordinary care every day, which includes ensuring  patients are provided safe care with no hospital-acquired complications. Clinical  nurses are especially diligent about the condition of patients&rsquo; skin, ensuring  this is continually monitored.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nursing care actions that clinical nurses perform  to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) include four-eyed assessment  on admission and transfer, with two clinical nurses reviewing all skin surfaces  to assess for pressure ulcers. Nurses also complete the Braden Pressure Ulcer  Scale every shift, looking at conditions that affect the patient&rsquo;s skin such as  sensory, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction and shear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP is fortunate to have an internal expert such as Nurse  Clinician Renee Mende, BSN, RN, CWOCN, Wound  Care, to assist clinical nurses with issues related to wounds. Mende, BGP&rsquo;s  wound care internal expert, holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree and  is certified as a Wound, Ostomy, Continence Nurse (CWOCN) by the Wound, Ostomy  and Continence Nurses Society, of which she is an active member. Mende started  her wound care career at the Outpatient Wound Care Center in December 2000, and  she transferred to In-Patient Wound Care in August 2011. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende&rsquo;s role as an internal expert in wound care  includes the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishing treatment plans for patients with  complex wounds and fistulas</li>
  <li>Using research findings as a basis for nursing care  related to wound, incontinence and ostomy patients</li>
  <li>Coordinating the selections and proper use of  therapeutic mattresses for wound and palliative patients</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her role, Mende serves as a consultant and  resource for internal customers such as clinical nurses, physicians and  hospital medical staff, hospital administrative supervisors and care  management. She also serves as a consultant and  resource for external customers such as patients and families, hospice nurses,  nursing care centers and home care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende serves on many committees as BGP&rsquo;s wound care  expert. These include the Corporate Wound Care Committee, Wound Care Prevalence  Committee, Model of Care Committee and the Quality and Safety Committee, and  she is an ad hoc member of the Patient Safety  Committee,. Mende is also responsible for BGP&rsquo;s quarterly NDNQI pressure ulcer  prevalence survey.  She uses her  knowledge and expertise to guide BGP in current evidence-based practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the first quarter 2016 pressure ulcer prevalence  study, a hospital-acquired nasal pressure ulcer was discovered on a 67-year-old  male patient on 3 West. It was discovered by a nursing student, verified by  Mende and Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice  and Magnet Program Director, and classified as a stage II hospital-acquired  nasal pressure ulcer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of HAPUs at BGP has varied from quarter  to quarter over the past two years. A review of the data for the previous eight  quarters showed that five quarters were below the mean for HAPUs. Mende, BGP  wound care internal expert, reviewed the data from the prevalence study and  noted that 3 West had its second hospital-acquired nasal pressure ulcer in as  many years. She set up a meeting with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, to discuss her findings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In first quarter 2016, 3 West&rsquo;s rate of hospital-acquired  device-related nasal pressure ulcers was 5%. This is measured by dividing the  number of patients with a hospital-acquired nasal pressure ulcers by the number  of patients surveyed.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the percentage of patients with a  hospital-acquired nasal pressure ulcer on 3 West.  This is measured by dividing the number of patients with a hospital-acquired  device-related nasal pressure ulcer by the number of patients surveyed.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>April 2016</em><br>
  Mende met with 3 West nursing leaders Patricia  Ackley, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, and Molly Brieden, BSN, RN, Assistant  Nurse Manager, to discuss the findings of the pressure ulcer prevalence study,  which showed that this was the second nasal pressure ulcer identified on 3 West  in the last two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende also completed a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; of the nasal  pressure ulcer, which at BGP involves a complete review of the chart and a detailed  discussion with the clinical nurse and nursing care assistants to determine the  cause of the pressure ulcer. Mende met with clinical nurses April Rishel, RN;  Erin Dionne, BSN, RN; Amanda Kady, BSN, RN; and Ashlee Owens, BSN, RN to  discuss the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was discovered during the deep dive that the  pressure was caused by a nasogastric (NG) tube that was lying on the mucosal of  the nose. The patient required the NG tube because of abdominal surgery. The  clinical nurses told Mende that 3 West, as a medical/surgical floor, receives abdominal  surgical patients, and that since many of them have NG tubes this could happen  again. The NG tube is taped to the patient&rsquo;s nose, which is what caused the  pressure ulcer. (Nasal pressure ulcers are not seen on BGP&rsquo;s other inpatient  units since most patients with an NG tube are on 3 West.)Mende informed the nurses that she knew of a product  that could decrease pressure ulcers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late April 2016, Mende met with Cynthia Harrison,  Director of Materials Management, to review products that are available to prevent  nasal pressure ulcers. Mende suggested that she and Harrison reach out to the  other hospitals in Beaumont Health to find out what products were being used.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2016 </em><br>
  Mende researched many products with Harrison&rsquo;s  assistance, and they discovered that Beaumont Health&rsquo;s inventory includes a Suction  Tube Attachment Device manufactured by Hollister. This bandage-like product  sticks to the nose with a small clip on the end that the NG tube is inserted,  thereby preventing the NG tube from resting on the nasal mucosal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende demonstrated the product to 3 West clinical  nurses, who believed it might work.  They  discussed how some clinical nurses might find it difficult to work with, but  all believed it was worth using.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2016 </em><br>
  Mende, as the internal expert on pressure ulcers,  conducted in-servicing on nursing units 3 West, 2 South Medical Surgical, 3  South Medical Surgical, Critical Care Unit and Critical Care Stepdown. Although  the nasal pressure ulcer occurred on 3 West, and no other unit has had one,  Mende believed it was important enough that all clinical nurses should be aware  of the product. The product was well received and is currently being used in all  inpatient nursing units. The product is stocked on the units by Materials  Management so it is readily available to clinical nurses. Mende used her expert  knowledge to prevent further hospital-acquired nasal pressure ulcers on 3 West  and hospital-wide.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  Nursing practice changes guided by internal expert  Renee Mende, BSN, RN, CWOCN, Wound Care Clinician, led to patient care improvements  on 3 West. Following the interventions by Mende&rsquo;s team, the percentage of  hospital-acquired device-related nasal pressure ulcers on 3 West decreased from  5% in first quarter 2016 to 0% in first quarter 2017. </p>
