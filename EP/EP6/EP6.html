<p><strong>Nurses Incorporating Specialty Standards/Guidelines into the  Delivery of Care:  Postpartum Hemorrhage </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AWHONN Specialty Standards and Guidelines</strong><br>
  In  2014, the Association of Women&rsquo;s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses  (AWHONN) launched the Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Project with the goal of  reducing the number of women who bleed to death during or after childbirth. The  project outlined recommendations for the management of PPH, including improving  clinicians&rsquo; recognition of, readiness for and response to PPH. In accordance with the AWHONN recommendations, the  recognition, prevention and treatment of PPH is a priority for the Family Birth  Center (FBC) at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurses Review of Specialty Standards and Guidelines</strong><br>
  On  April 14, 2015, the BGP FBC leadership team,  including Patricia Heitz, RNC, Assistant Nurse Manager; Janice Davis, BSN, RNC,  Assistant Nurse Manager; and  Marisa Engel, MSN, RNC, Clinical Nurse Specialist, attended the Michigan Hospital  Association (MHA) Keystone Obstetric Workshop with Keystone OB Champion  Cheryl Gibson-Fountain, MD. The conference focused on another Michigan  hospital&rsquo;s successful implementation of a Postpartum Hemorrhage Program, and  the improved outcomes that were achieved as a result. Conference attendees  participated in an Evaluation of Blood Loss and Educational Workstation  activity that involved a simulation of a postpartum hemorrhage and hands-on  practice estimating and weighing samples to demonstrate that estimation is not  an accurate way to measure blood loss. After attending this conference, the BGP participants collaborated  with Michael Mahoney, MD, Chief of the OB Department, to implement the  postpartum risk assessment into practice, <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP6-1.pdf">(Evidence EP6-1, OB Hemorrhage Task Force, May 20, 2016)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating Specialty Standards into the Delivery of Care</strong><br>
  In May 2014, the BGP FBC began  participating in the Michigan Hospital Association Keystone OB Obstetric  Hemorrhage collaborative. The FBC began collecting data on several areas  specific to the recognition and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and  reporting it to the MHA monthly. This process helped the FBC clinical nurses  and leaders identify possible areas for improvement, including the assessment  of PPH risk and active management of the third stage of labor.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically,  postpartum bleeding has been &ldquo;estimated&rdquo; by the physician. This practice is  known to be inaccurate, leading to postpartum hemorrhage not being consistently  recognized in a timely manner. AWHONN recommends that cumulative blood loss be  formally measured or quantified after every birth. Formal methods such as weighing  and using calibrated drapes reduce the likelihood that blood loss will be  underestimated and allow for early recognition and treatment. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP6-2.pdf">(Evidence EP6-2, Quantification of  Blood Loss: AWHONN Practice Brief Number 1 and AWHONN Postpartum Hemorrhage  Project) </a>The goal is to give clinical nurse the tools and knowledge to  accurately measure the amount of blood loss so that a &ldquo;quantified blood loss&rdquo;  (QBL) can be documented on the Delivery Summary instead of an &ldquo;estimated blood  loss&rdquo; (EBL). It was determined that Engel would educate the FBC staff on practice  changes in the management of postpartum hemorrhage based on the AWHONN  guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  February 2015, all clinical nurses on the FBC attended the Postpartum  Hemorrhage Risk Assessment and Quantification of Blood Loss presentation, given  by Engel. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP6-3.pdf">(Evidence EP6-3, Postpartum Hemorrhage Risk Assessment and  Quantification of Blood Loss Quiz and Sign-in Sheet)</a> The clinical nurses  reviewed the risk factors for PPH and the appropriate interventions to implement  for high-risk patients, including physician notification and sending a type and  screen in the event that a blood transfusion is warranted. The indications for the  use of uterotonics (cytotec, methergine and hemabate) to prevent or treat PPH  were also reviewed. Engel outlined the recognition of PPH, including the  acceptable volume of blood loss for both vaginal and cesarean delivery. The  presentation also included a PPH simulation with clinical scenarios and  validation of clinical nurses&rsquo; skill in quantifying blood loss, allowing them  to practice their assessment skills. Blood loss was simulated using red juice  and jello in different volumes on blue pads or peri-pads. The clinical nurses  practiced first estimating how much &ldquo;blood&rdquo; was on the pads, and then practiced  weighing the saturated pads on a gram scale and calculating the quantified  volume of &ldquo;blood&rdquo; on the pads.     </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  2015, three Beaumont Health Care Hospitals, Grosse Pointe, Royal Oak and Troy, joined  forces to improve the recognition, prevention and treatment of PPH. The STORK subject  matter experts from each site developed a physician order to improve the assessment  and documentation of PPH risk. (The STORK subject matter experts are nurse  super users for the OB part of the EPIC electronic medical record.) The  Obstetrical Hemorrhage Risk Assessment order was implemented on March 27, 2015,  and was included on the admission order sets to allow for PPH risk assessment  on all patients admitted to FBC. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP6-4.pdf">(Evidence EP6-4, EPIC Order Set for Post-Partum Hemorrhage Risk  Assessment)</a> The OB Antenatal Admission, OB Admission and Surgical OB  C-section Pre-Op order sets were modified to include an assessment of PPH risk  factors to determine whether the patient is low or high risk for PPH, and the  order for the type and screen. The implementation of the Obstetrical Hemorrhage  Risk Assessment in the order set has enabled the clinical nurse to perform a  formal assessment of PPH risk on admission and document it in the electronic  medical record.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  May 2015, a PPH cart was assembled based on the California Maternal Quality  Care Collaborative (CMQCC) Checklist for Recommended Instruments for OB  Hemorrhage Carts. According to the CMQCC guidelines, the physician should have  rapid access to surgical instruments and tools designed to treat PPH. The  supplies in the cart are used in the treatment of vaginal or cervical  lacerations, uterine tamponade, and uterine or  ovarian artery ligation. The cart provides all the instruments needed to treat  PPH before a hysterectomy is considered. CMQCC PPH management algorithms were  also posted on the cart for reference. Prior to implementing the cart, all  clinical nurses attended an in-service that outlined the contents of the cart  and how the items would be used. A quiz was then administered to assess the  clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge of the cart contents and their ability to follow the  treatment algorithm and locate items in the cart. Education on the PPH cart is  now part of the FBC nursing orientation to ensure that new clinical nurses receive the same education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Improvement in Care Delivery </strong><br>
  In  June 2015, all the components of PPH management were successfully implemented. Data  has continued to be collected and reported to MHA Keystone OB Obstetric  Hemorrhage. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP6-5.pdf">(Evidence EP6-5,  Keystone PPH Process and Outcome Measure)</a> The data demonstrates great  improvements in the recognition and treatment of PPH. As of February 2016, a  PPH risk assessment is completed for all patients admitted to the FBC, and the  appropriate preventive measures are implemented. There have also been  improvements in the documentation of the active management of the third stage  of labor. In September 2015, only 50% of patients had post-delivery oxytocin  documented, whereas the June 2016 data shows that 86% of patients had this  documentation completed. </p>
