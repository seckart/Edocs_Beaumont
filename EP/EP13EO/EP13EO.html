<h2>Interprofessional Care EP13EO</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Nurses  participate in interprofessional groups that implement and evaluate coordinated  patient education activities.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Provide one example, with supporting evidence, of an interprofessional patient education activity that was associated with an improved patient outcome. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table that clearly displays the data.</em> </li>
 


</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing Length of Stay for 3 South  Orthopaedic Spinal Surgery Patients – &ldquo;Back on Track&rdquo;Class</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Poor surgical preparation can cause patients and  families anxiety about their pending surgery and treatment plan. A lack of  adequate preoperative education and discharge planning can also result in a  longer length of stay and negative outcomes such as infection, deep vein  thrombosis, urinary tract infection, mobility issues and other postoperative  complications. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cathleen Solecki, MSN, RN, CCRN, CNRN, Program  Manager Neurology<em>,</em> represents  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) at the Beaumont Health System Corporate  Neurological Centers of Excellence Committee (COE). The objectives of the Neuro  COE include sharing best practices, streamlining and standardizing treatment  practices and driving process improvement.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the September 2013 Neuro COE meeting, the  committee discussed the length of stay (LOS) on the BGP 3 South Orthopaedic  unit and identified an opportunity to decrease it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solecki scheduled a meeting with Alexis Rogers, RN,  ONC, Orthopaedic Assistant Nurse Manager, and Lisa Hartner, Orthopaedic Joint  Coordinator, to discuss the COE&rsquo;s concerns and the need to decrease LOS on the  unit. The Orthopaedic unit&rsquo;s LOS was higher than projected according to one of  the benchmarks the COE uses, the Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement  Collaborative (MSSIC). The  MSSIC is a statewide quality improvement collaborative involving orthopedic  surgeons and neurosurgeons, with the aim of improving the quality of care for  spine surgery. The objective of this collaborative is to improve patient care  outcomes while increasing the efficiency of treatment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The COE instructed BGP to develop a process  improvement to decrease the LOS for spine surgery patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers, Solecki and Hartner brainstormed ideas, and  Rogers suggested that a program similar to the BGP Total Joint Program (TJP)  might decrease the LOS for spine surgery patients. The TJP is an interprofessional  education program for patients undergoing total joint replacements. It had been  instituted four years earlier and dramatically decreased the LOS and improved patient  satisfaction in the total joint replacement patient population. Rogers, Solecki  and Hartner agreed to try a program like this since it had had a positive  effect for joint patients.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2013, Rogers met with Phyllis Reynolds,  MSN, RN, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at the time, to obtain  approval. Rogers, Solecki and Hartner determined that an interprofessional  group was needed to develop, implement and facilitate the program. This group,  the Spine Patient Education Committee, comprised the following disciplines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nursing</li>
  <li>Care Management</li>
  <li>Physical Therapy </li>
  <li>Occupational Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solecki and Hartner agreed to take the lead on  developing the program to decrease the 3 South Orthopaedic unit&rsquo;s spine surgery  patient length of stay. The team reviewed the data, which showed that the  average LOS for spinal surgery patients on 3 South Orthopaedic was 3.06 days in  fourth quarter 2013. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the average  length of stay for spinal surgery patients, measured in days, for 3 South  Orthopaedic.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>January 2014</em><br>
  The Spine Patient  Education Committee developed the goal of decreasing the LOS for 3 South  Orthopaedic spinal surgery patients. The committee included members from nursing,  Care Management, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Hospital  Administration. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After much discussion,  the committee decided to develop a preoperative spinal education program for  all patients coming to BGP for spinal surgery. The program would be similar to  the Total Joint Program.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spine Patient  Education Committee met to develop the program. The overall goal was to provide  an education activity for spinal surgery patients covering the entire surgical experience,  from preoperative education to discharge planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The committee reviewed  the Total Joint Program and determined which topics could also be used for the  spine patient education. Solecki and Hartner met with Rogers from the Orthopedic  units; Jill Phillips, MPT, Physical Therapist; Michele Sucharski, MPT, Manager,  Occupational Therapy; and Judith Sudomier, RN, Care Manager, Care Management,  to discuss the program outline.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program, called  Back on Track, was developed based on the input of the four disciplines and  designed to be similar to the Total Joint Program, but with a focus on spinal surgery  patients.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Back on Track class  outline included the following topics:<br>
  <br>
  Nursing</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to prepare for surgery</li>
  <li>Spinal Anatomy</li>
  <li>Spinal Procedures</li>
  <li>Infection Prevention</li>
  <li>Before your Surgery</li>
  <li>During your Surgery</li>
  <li>After your Surgery</li>
  <li>Hospital Stay</li>
  <li>Integrative Therapies such as music, aroma and  massage</li>
  <li>Pain Management</li>
  <li>Wound Care</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical Therapy </p>
<ul>
  <li>Home Preparation</li>
  <li>In-Patient Therapy</li>
  <li>Out-Patient Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occupational Therapy </p>
<ul>
  <li>Home Preparation</li>
  <li>In-Patient Therapy</li>
  <li>Out-Patient Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Care Management</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discharge Planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The classes, to be held at Beaumont Grosse Pointe  every Monday from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., would consist of an interactive  discussion along with a PowerPoint presentation.  The classes were not mandatory, but strongly  encouraged. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the committee developed the program, it asked  Patricia Jax, BSN, RN, clinical nurse who was in charge of the Total Joint  Program, to review it and make suggestions for improvement. After discussing it  with Reynolds, it was decided that Jax would also teach the class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February 2014</em><br>
  A flyer was developed to be delivered to all orthopedic  physicians who perform surgery at BGP. The flyer reviews the objectives of the  Back on Track class, the topics covered and how to register.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The committee worked on the preoperative protocol  for the surgeon, hospital and pre-admission testing. A work flow was developed  to ensure that patients were getting the proper pre-procedure pathway so they  would be appropriately educated before coming to surgery. It was important that  all protocol be followed, as the steps in the protocol were discussed in the  classes. The work flow consisted of the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-op Protocol for Surgeon&rsquo;s Office</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physician distributes chlorhexidine to the patients</li>
  <li>Physician gives a prescription for a nasal swab to  check for MRSA</li>
  <li>Physician distributes flyer and encourages  attendance at the Back on Track class</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-op Protocol for Hospital</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scheduled surgical patients are contacted by  Jax, who invites them to a Back on Track class and encourages attendance. If they  are unable to attend, she will mail the educational materials to the patient  and family.</li>
  <li>The pre-op laboratory work that is required  for surgery is reviewed, and the patients are  encouraged to the complete these tests on the day of the Back on Track class.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-op Protocol for Pre-Admission Testing</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pre-admission nurses contact patients to discuss  pre-admission testing requirements and review the schedule for showering with chlorhexidine  prior to surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March 2014</em><br>
  All work for the Back on Track program was completed  and the classes began. </p>
