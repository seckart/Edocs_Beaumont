<p><strong>Example One: 3 West Nurses Using Resources to  Address Ethical Issues</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is  committed to facilitating the resolution of conflicts and concerns that can  arise due to the competing values and beliefs of patients, families and staff  members. The clinical ethics consultation service is a mechanism in place to  respectfully address a clinical ethical issue involving the care of a patient.  As part of new hire orientation, employees  receive information and education on the availability of Ethics Case Consultations  and how to request one. Patients and families are made aware of the  availability of this service in the patient and visitor guide that is provided  to each patient at the time of their admission to the hospital. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests  for Consultation </strong><br>
  A request for a clinical Ethics Case Consultation  can be made by patients, family members, surrogates, nursing staff members and  anyone else involved in the patient&rsquo;s care. Requests can be placed by leaving a  voicemail message on the BGP Ethics Hotline at 313-473-6222, or any staff  member with Epic access may place an order requesting an Ethics Case Consultation  into the computer. Requests left on the Ethics Hotline may remain anonymous.  Any  member of the care team can request an Ethics Case Consultation, and no one  (including the attending or consulting physician) has the authority to prevent  or rescind this request. Patients and/or their surrogates should be  informed of any pending Ethics Case Consultation and asked whether they would  like to participate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Ethics Case Consultation  meeting, the team leader or designee enters a note in the patient&rsquo;s medical  record indicating the Ethics Case Consultation team&rsquo;s assessment of the ethical  issues and recommended course of action, with ethical justification. The Ethics  Case Consultation team leader contacts the attending physician with these  findings. The Ethics Case Consultation team is responsible to provide clinical  ethics consultation to advise the care team about ethical issues related to  patient care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  of an Ethical Issue Related to Clinical Practice</strong><br>
  In September 2015, Pat Ackley, BSN, RN,  Associate Nurse Manager of 3 West, contacted  Edmund Neumaier, BSN, RN, CHPN, Palliative Care Coordinator, with concerns  raised by one of her clinical nurses, Erin Savinov, RN. The Palliative Care Coordinator  has the role of first responder to the Ethics Hotline and ethics referrals made  by individuals. The first responder&rsquo;s role is to gather information and attempt  to identify the underlying ethical concern. Savinov was distressed by the level  of suffering she had observed the patient going through due to her extensive  wounds, dialysis, recurrent bouts of sepsis and the length of her illness  without signs of improvement.  Savinov  further reported concern that the patient&rsquo;s daughter, who was named in her  advance directive as the primary decision maker, was having difficulty coping  not only with her mother&rsquo;s illness, but with the overall burden of decision  making. Savinov believed this was evidenced by her refusal to allow for a  palliative care consult and her agitation with physicians and staff members  when attempts were made to discuss her mother&rsquo;s poor prognosis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neumaier entered a Request for Clinical Ethics Case Consultation into  Epic on September 10, 2015, with a consult reason of concerns regarding complex  care and goals of care.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP17-1.pdf">(Evidence EP17-1, Epic Order for Case Consultation)</a>  Neumaier, acting in the role of ethics first  responder, conducted a chart review and informal discussion with those caring  for the patient. These included Critical Care Unit (CCU) clinical nurses Savinov; Linda Amato, RN; Necola Table, RN; and  Gail Pagels BSN, RN, CCRN; Renae Mende, BSN, RN, CWCN, Wound Care Nurse; Gwen  Colorito, LMSW; Sailaja Datla, MD, Attending Physician; and Robert Marchese,  MD, Pulmonologist.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient was an 80-year-old female  who had been ill for almost a year with prolonged hospitalizations followed by  repeated admissions to long-term acute care hospital facilities and extended  care facilities. She had been discharged home two weeks prior to this admission  and started developing a small pressure ulcer, which developed into a stage II  ulcer that was being cared for at home by the visiting nurse.  The patient was found to be unresponsive  during her outpatient hemodialysis treatment, and EMS brought her to the  Emergency Department. There she was diagnosed with sepsis, and subsequent blood  cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of the consult request, the  patient had been hospitalized 45 days with recurrent bouts of sepsis,  congestive heart failure, severe protein  malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes and increasingly intolerance to  hemodialysis treatments. The patient&rsquo;s mental status fluctuated based on her  illness, with her baseline being alert and oriented to person and place, and  she routinely deferred decision making to her daughter, as indicated in her  durable power of attorney for healthcare.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The daughter had repeatedly reported to Datla,  the patient&rsquo;s attending physician, that she believed her mother would make a  full recovery and that she wanted full resuscitation in the event of  cardiopulmonary arrest. She was resistant to discussing any plan of care that  deviated from a full recovery with her mother being discharged home from the  hospital. Initial attempts to discuss alternative plans of care were met with  agitation and avoidance by the daughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Palliative Care contacted the daughter  to explain the purpose and value of an Ethics Case Consultation, work with her  to coordinate and schedule a meeting and encourage her to invite her  siblings.  The daughter, as the patient  advocate, reacted positively to the presentation of the meeting as an  opportunity to discuss her mother&rsquo;s condition with the physicians and nurses  caring for her. She was in agreement with including her siblings, and reported  feeling overwhelmed with the responsibility of being the sole decision  maker.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information that had been gathered was  discussed with Beaumont Health Ethicist Paul J. Reitemeier, PhD, and the  ethical concern was determined to be the non-beneficial treatment expectations  of surrogate decision makers. Arrangements were made for a formal case consultation,  at which all concerned parties were invited to be present. The meeting was set  for September 17, 2015 at 9 a.m. It was attended by members of the Ethics Case  Consultation team, invited members of the patient care team and the patient&rsquo;s  four adult children. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP17-2.pdf">(Evidence  EP17-2, Sign-in Sheet for Ethics Case Consultation)</a></p>

<p align="center">EP17, Ethics  Case Consultation Participants </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting was led by Jeanne  Lewandowski, MD, a member of the BGP Ethics Committee. All those present  participated in the discussion respective to their area of specialty, and they  answered the family&rsquo;s questions about their mother&rsquo;s condition and clinical  course. The care options they discussed included the limitations of continuing  life sustaining treatments and the initiation of comfort measures. Savinov and  Neumaier validated the siblings&rsquo; love for their mother and their desire for her  to remain with them.  Active listening  and emotional support were provided. The siblings made a decision and reported  together that, despite wanting their mother to remain with them, they did not  want her to continue to endure medical treatments that would not result in her  recovery.  The family members were able  to express their concurrence with clinical recommendations for care without  conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ethical  Issue Addressed</strong><br>
  As a result of this meeting, changes  were made to the patient&rsquo;s plan of care. These included no escalation in  current medical intensive therapies, and resuscitation not to be attempted  since it had been deemed to be no longer beneficial. These changes were  implemented with the family in agreement. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP17-3.pdf">(Evidence EP17-3, Ethics Case Consultation Summation  and Recommendations)</a> All participants in the case consultation,  including clinical nursing staff members, believed the intervention had  provided a supportive and informative setting for the patient advocate and her  siblings to have their concerns addressed while bringing resolution to the  concerns that led to the case consultation. The  Ethics Case Consultation team&rsquo;s recommendations included that the family be  supported and assisted in decision making regarding the compassionate  extubation of the patient, followed by initiation of comfort measures with the  anticipation of the patient actively dying. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCU clinical nurses Amato and Angelica  Cooper, RN, and Palliative Care nurse Neumaier worked closely with the patient  and family over the six days following the ethics consultation to facilitate  the transition to comfort care, and they supported the patient and family with  life completion tasks. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP17-4.pdf">(Evidence EP17-4, Clinical Nursing Notes)</a> The patient expired comfortably with her  family at the bedside. The nurses involved in supporting the family through end  of life believed they were able to support the family through the process and  that the family exhibited improved coping and appropriate grieving following  their mother&rsquo;s death. </p>
