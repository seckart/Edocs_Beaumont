<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:&quot;Evaluating Registered Nurses'  Knowledge Regarding Evidence-Based Practice in Medical Surgical Nurses in a  Community Hospital&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evidence-based  practice (EBP) is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision making that  incorporates a search for the best and latest evidence, clinical expertise and  assessment, and patient preference values into the context of caring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  October 2016, after obtaining the Beaumont Health System Institutional Review  Board (IRB) approval, a 29-question survey was administered to medical/surgical  nurses on 2 South, 3 South and 3 West. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  study, titled &ldquo;Evaluating Registered Nurses&rsquo; Knowledge regarding Evidence-Based  Practice in Medical Surgical Nurses in a Community Hospital,&rdquo; was conducted by  Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice as the  Primary Investigator (PI), and Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Chief Nursing  Officer, as the Co-Primary Investigator.<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-1.pdf"> (Evidence  NK2-1, IRB Approval Letter for Research # 2016-343)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  purpose of the study was to evaluate the EBP knowledge of nurses on three  medical/surgical units at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP). The researchers were  trying to determine whether an active unit practice council (UPC) increased nurses&rsquo;  knowledge of EBP. The UPCs are the shared governance structure at Beaumont  Grosse Pointe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  hypothesis was based on the researchers&rsquo; knowledge of the three units and the  activities of the UPCs. It was anticipated that 3 West would score the highest,  followed by 2 South, and that 3 South would score the lowest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study  measured five factors related to nurses&rsquo; knowledge of EBP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Organization  Culture</li>
  <li>Unit  Culture </li>
  <li>Knowledge  and Skill of Nurse</li>
  <li>Time </li>
  <li>Attitude</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As  anticipated, the unit that scored the highest was 3 West, which has the most  active UPC.  The unit with the next  highest score was 3 South, which has the least active UPC. The surprising results  were from 2 South, which had the lowest score; this result was not anticipated  by the PI or Co-PI. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-2.pdf">(Evidence NK2-2, Results of the  Research Study)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Obtained</strong><br>
  The  study&rsquo;s hypothesis was partially met. In the research proposal, it was  hypothesized that an active UPC increased nurses&rsquo; knowledge of EBP. This proved  accurate on 3 West, which scored the highest in all five categories and has the  most active UPC. This UPC conducts a Journal Club for nurses to review journal  articles for the most current practice in a medical/surgical unit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  researchers also determined that the age and experience of the clinical nurse  plays an important role in the knowledge of EBP. 2 South, with the second most active  UPC, scored the lowest on the survey. A review of the data showed that a higher  percentage of 2 South nurses were age 41 or older: 51.9% on 2 south, compared  to 37.1% on 3 West and 23.1% on 3 South. The experience level of clinical nurses  might also play a role: 33.3% of 2 South clinical nurses had 20 or more years  of experience, compared to 7.4% on 3 West and 7.7% on 3 South. </p>
<p>The researchers  believed the age and experience of the nurses may have contributed to the lower  scores on 2 South, as EBP was most likely not studied when these clinical  nurses completed basic nursing school. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  researchers also identified in the results that clinical nurses cited time as a  major issue in their knowledge of EBP, as the &ldquo;Time&rdquo; factor received the lowest  score in all three units. The two Time questions in the survey were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nurses  have enough time on the job to implement EBP findings</li>
  <li>I  could find one hour per week on the job for EBP activities, if I made it a  priority</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scores for the  Time questions are presented in the table below. They are scored on a scale of  1-5, with 1 being &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; and 5 being &ldquo;strongly agree.&rdquo;

<p align="center">NK2, Results of the Time Questions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The researchers  also identified that the unit culture is more supportive of EBP than the  organizational culture. These results demonstrated that the hospital must do  more to encourage and support EBP. This might be related to the issue of time:  If clinical nurses do not have enough time to complete EBP activities, this  might be interpreted as the organization not supporting EBP. </p>

<p><strong>Clinical  Nurses&rsquo; Dissemination of the Knowledge Obtained</strong><br>
  The results were discussed with Alexis  Rogers, BSN, RN, ONC, Administrative Manager, 3 South, and Pam Lively, BSN, RN,  NE-BDC, Administrative Manager, 2 South, both of whom believed that these units&rsquo;  clinical nurses should own the results and develop a plan to correct any deficiencies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The researchers presented the study  findings to the UPC on 2 South and to Team Leader Julie Lynch, BSN, RN,  clinical nurse on 3 South. The researchers believed the units should own the  results, disseminate the information to their peers on the unit and present the  results and plans for improvement to other professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were presented internally by  2 South clinical nurses Emily Gross, BSN, RN; Michael Hoekstra, BSN, RN; and  Timothy Pierce, BSN, RN to the Professional Nurse Council on May 10, 2017, and  externally by Julie Lynch, BSN, RN, 3 South Charge Nurse, at a conference titled,  &ldquo;Taking the Lead 2017: Leading Systems, Others and Self.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPC clinical nurses were supported by  the researchers (Whitney and Stewart) in reviewing the data. Deb Briske, MSN,  RN, CEN, 2 South Clinical Nurse Specialist, supported the groups with the presentations,  and BGP supported the group financially with the costs related to these  presentations.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Randy  Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice and PI of the research  study, reviewed the demographics of the study, including sex, age, education  level, years as a registered nurse, years at Beaumont, employment status, shift  worked, position and current education activities. Deb Briske, MSN, RN, CEN,  Clinical Nurse Specialist for 2 South, assisted the 2 South UPC members in  developing their presentation through which they disseminated the information  obtained from the research study. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-3.pdf">(Evidence NK2-3, Agenda of UPC)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the data, the UPC decided to focus on the Unit Culture and improve the clinical  nurses&rsquo; knowledge regarding EBP. They agreed with the conclusion of the nurse  researchers that, because of the age and experience of the 2 South nurses, EBP  had not been taught when these nurses completed a nursing education program.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Internal Dissemination of the Knowledge  Obtained</strong><br>
  The 2  South UPC members presented the results of the research study completed on 2  South at the hospital Professional Nurse Council (PNC) meeting on May 10, 2017,  during BGP&rsquo;s celebration of Nurses Week. The PNC, which is a council of BGP&rsquo;s  shared governance model, consists of clinical nurses from all areas where  nursing is practiced and three nurse leaders who serve as advisors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gross,  Hoekstra and Pierce presented the key findings of the research study on 2  South. 2 South UPC clinical nurses shared with the PNC future plans for 2  South, including developing a bulletin board for EBP articles to be posted,  possibly starting a journal club, providing ongoing education on EBP and repeating  the study in six to 12 months to determine whether the education was  beneficial<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-4.pdf">. (Evidence NK2-4,  Agenda and Minutes from May 10, 2017 PNC Meeting; Brochure and Handout from 2  South)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  results of the research that was completed on 2 South and the plan for how to  improve clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge regarding EBP was well received by the PNC  and other nursing staff members. More than 25 people were in attendance as 2  South disseminated the research findings to this internal audience. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/Nk2-5.pdf">(Evidence NK2-5, Sign-in Sheet for  PNC Meeting) </a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Clinical Nurse Dissemination to an External Audience – &ldquo;Taking the Lead  2017: Leading Systems, Others and Self&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>In late  November 2016, the preliminary results of the survey were presented to Alexis  Rogers, BSN, RN, 3 South Administrative Manager, and Julie Lynch, BSN, RN, 3  South Team Leader, by Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of  Professional Practice and PI of the research study. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynch had  been extremely interested to see the results of the survey, as she believed 3  South was lacking in knowledge of EBP and was interested in assisting her peers  in improving their knowledge.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of  the purposes of the study was to determine the nurses&rsquo; knowledge regarding EBP  and to use the data to formulate an action plan to increase the knowledge and  awareness of EBP in the 3 South Orthopaedic Unit.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Obtained</strong><br>
  Lynch  reviewed with Rogers the results of the survey, which indicated that the  clinical nurses on 3 South believed that time and knowledge and skills were  factors in their knowledge of EBP. The results indicated that there was no time  for and little knowledge of EBP activities on 3 South.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the results, Lynch, with Rogers&rsquo; assistance, implemented five activities that  would improve 3 South clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge of EBP. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Development  of a Resource Room – This was a room designated on the unit as a lounge where  clinical nurses could unwind and review educational materials.</li>
  <li>Development  of a Journal Club –  This would be  designed to review journal articles that support the concepts of EBP.</li>
  <li>Development  of a Book Shelf – 3 South clinical nurses were encouraged to bring in gently  used current journals and textbooks for other staff members to read. </li>
  <li>Implementation  of Education Huddles – These were 2-3 minute huddles to discuss any educational  topic.</li>
  <li>Encouragement  for nurses on the unit to complete a BSN degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynch shared  these strategies with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Chief Nursing Officer  and Co-PI of the research study, who said these were excellent ideas and  suggested to Lynch that she meet with Whitney to explore ways to disseminate  this information outside of BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>External Dissemination of the Knowledge  Obtained</strong><br>
  Stewart  reviewed a call for poster abstracts for the conference &ldquo;Taking the Lead 2017:  Leading Systems, Others and Self&rdquo;, and she shared the  information with Lynch. The conference was held on January 16, 2017 at the  Kensington Court Hotel in Ann Arbor, Michigan. </a>The sponsors of the event  were the Institute of Professional Nursing, Michigan League for Nursing,  Beaumont Health and the University of Michigan Health System. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-6.pdf">(Evidence NK2-6, Call for  Abstracts and Conference Brochure)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynch  submitted an abstract as the lead presenter, with the PI and Co-PI of the  research study as additional authors. On December 12, 2016, Lynch, as well as  Whitney and Stewart, were notified that the poster was accepted for  presentation at the &ldquo;Taking the Lead 2017: Leading Systems, Others and Self&rdquo;  conference. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-7.pdf">(Evidence NK2-7,  Abstract and Acceptance Letter) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynch  presented the findings at the conference through a poster. More than 300 nurses  from various hospitals in the metropolitan Detroit area attended the  conference, along with people from the local universities. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK2-8.pdf">(Evidence NK2-8, Handouts and CE Certificate)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  poster was well received at the conference and generated discussion regarding  the conclusion that was presented. The conclusion was:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The nurses in this  study demonstrated a similar level of knowledge of Evidence-Based Practice on  two of the three units, with different demographic data. 3 South has the  highest percentage of inexperienced nurses and the lowest percent of BSN nurses  but remained in the median of the 5 factors assessed&rdquo;.<br>
