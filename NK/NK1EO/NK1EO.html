<p><strong>INTRODUCTION  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evaluating  Registered Nurses&rsquo; Knowledge regarding Evidence-based  Practice in Medical Surgical Nurses in a Community Hospital&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary  Investigator: Randy G. Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC<br>
  Co-Primary  Investigator: Anne M. Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC<br>
  Study  Participants: Clinical Nurses – 2 South, 3 South and 3 West at <br>
  Beaumont  Grosse Pointe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Research Question and Hypothesis</strong><br>
  Research  Question: Do medical surgical nurses who have a strong Unit Practice Council  have greater knowledge regarding evidence-based practice than those nurses who  have a weaker Unit Practice Council?</p>
<p>Hypothesis:  Units with stronger Unit Practice Councils will have greater knowledge of  evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Study Rationale</strong><br>
  Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) has three medical surgical units, all of which have Unit  Practice Councils (UPC) at various levels of development. The UPCs are the shared  governance model that is used at BGP. The UPCs meet once a month to plan activities  that support the unit. They review issues such as patient care issues,  education needs and general unit operations.   These are staff-led councils that meet independent of nursing  leadership.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2 South  UPC is an active council that meets monthly and has input into the operation of  the unit. The 3 South UPC is less active and has been re-invigorated with a new  chairperson leading it since June 2016. The 3 West UPC is very active and  functions on its own with little assistance from nursing leadership. In  addition to the normal </p>
<p>functions of a UPC, this council has a Journal Club.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  purpose of this study was to determine whether 3 West had a greater knowledge  of evidence-based practice (EBP) due to its more  active UPC. The premises of the investigators were that  3 West would have the highest knowledge of EBP, followed by 2 South, and that 3  South would have the lowest knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Literature Review </strong><br>
  A review  of the literature provided some interesting facts regarding EBP. As healthcare  systems worldwide move toward instituting evidence-based practices, its implementation  can be challenging. Conducting a baseline assessment to determine nurses&rsquo;  knowledge of and readiness for EBP presents opportunities to plan strategies  before implementation (Thiel &amp; Ghosh, 2008).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A study  that was conducted in the United States and completed in 2005, &ldquo;Nurses  Readiness for EBP from the Perspective of Informational Literacy,&rdquo; showed that  &ldquo;RNs in the United States are not ready for EBP&rdquo; (Pravikoff, Tanner, &amp;  Pierce, 2005).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evidence-based  practice in nursing is an approach to clinical decision making based on the  combination of best evidence available, clinical expertise and patient values  and preference to improve outcomes. The importance of EBP in nursing has been  established with the demonstrated improvement in patient outcomes (Melnyk,  &amp; Finout-Overholt, 2011).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  ongoing evolution of nursing as a profession required the development of EBP outcomes  and nurses&rsquo; ability to access and evaluate professional literature. EBP  empowers nurses to form innovative learning partnerships with colleagues to  nourish and strengthen critical thinking skills, and to integrate research  knowledge in leading best practices. Literature suggests that much of current  practice is frequently based on experience, tradition and intuition rather than  on evidence. (Malik, G., McKenna, L., &amp; Plummer, V., 2014) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the  study by Malik, G. (2014), 95% of the participants used organizational policies  and protocols as first-line information and source of knowledge. This result  was different from previous published studies, in which nurses had been found  to rely mostly on colleagues and experience as a first source for  information.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  outcome of the Malik, G. (2014) study indicated that participants rely on  personal experience and organizational policies and protocols as formal sources  of knowledge.  They showed positive  attitudes toward EBP; however, lack of knowledge, poor skills, limited time and  lack of resources were perceived as major obstacles to implementing EBP. To  embrace EBP, nurses need time away from bedside responsibilities, autonomy over  practice, education on finding and accessing evidence and mentorship for  successful implementation. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Research Sample</strong><br>
      This was  a descriptive, explorative survey in which medical surgical nurses from three  medical surgical units were asked to complete a 29-question 2005 Nursing  Evidence-Based Practice Survey and to provide some non-identifying demographic  information.  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All  nurses on the three units were given the opportunity to participate in the  voluntary study. The sample size consisted of 39 registered nurses from 2  South, 31 registered nurses from 3 South and 36 registered nurses from 3 West.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collection Methods</strong><br>
      The 29-question  2005 Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Survey was distributed along with a  request for some non-identifying demographic information. The hard-copy surveys  were distributed by hand by the staffing clerk in the Nursing Business Office.  It was decided that since both Whitney and Stewart are in leadership positions,  a neutral party, Dunn, would distribute the surveys to prevent any feeling of  coercion. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The packet included a cover letter, an information sheet, the demographic  sheet and the survey. Each packet included an envelope addressed to Whitney so  they could be returned anonymously. At this point this was a one-time study,  although it may be repeated in three to five years. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK1EO-4.pdf">(Evidence NK1EO-4, Survey Packet)</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  results of the 29-question survey were categorized into five factors to  determine the nurses&rsquo; knowledge of and readiness for evidence-based practice.  The five factors were Organizational Culture, Unit Culture, Knowledge and Skill  of the Nurse, Time and Attitude.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organizational  Culture was defined as: Does Beaumont Grosse Pointe support the use of  evidence-based practice in nurses&rsquo; practices? </li>
      <li>Unit  Culture was defined as: Does the unit nursing leadership and staff support the use  of evidence-based practice? </li>
      <li>Knowledge  and Skill of the Nurse was defined as: Do the nurses on the unit know what  evidence-based practice is, do they know where to find the evidence-based  information and do they use evidence-based information in their nursing  practice?  </li>
      <li>Time  was defined as: Do the nurses have time to research and utilize evidence in  their daily practice and do they have time to implement their findings?  </li>
      <li>Attitude  measures how the nurse feels about evidence-based practice.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  survey used a 5-point Likert scale: 1- Strongly Disagree, 2- Disagree,  3-Uncertain, 4-Agree and 5-Strongly Agree. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS (Quantitative)</strong><br>
      A total  of 67 nurses, 63.2% of nurses, returned the survey that was distributed and  open from October 23, 2016 to December 2, 2016.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Significance  of the Results</strong> <br>
  For the  five factors that the study looked at, 3 West had the highest score of the  three units and also had results that were higher than the average of the  units. For Unit Culture, 3 West had a score of 4.10 compared to 2 South&rsquo;s score  of 2.43. It is interesting to note that 3 West is the unit that has the most  active UPC.</p>

<p align="center">NK1EO, Survey Results Based on the Five Factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Key Findings</strong><br>
  The study  demonstrates that the nurses believe that evidence-based practice is an  important part of the nursing care that is provided. However, time seems to be  a factor in the use of evidence, as the scores for Time were the lowest of all  five factors. The Unit Culture (3.80) is more supportive of evidence-based  practice than the Organization Culture (3.43). The hypothesis was partially  correct, in that 3 West, the unit with the most active UPC, scored the highest  in all five factors. The 2 South unit, with the second most active UPC, scored  the lowest in all five factors, and the 3 South unit, with the least active UPC,  had the second highest scores in all five factors.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of the Findings</strong><br>
  In this study,  the goal was to evaluate the knowledge regarding evidence-based practice of  medical surgical registered nurses in a community hospital. The research  question was, Does the unit with a strong UPC have greater knowledge regarding  evidence-based practice? When analyzing the results the following must be  noted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  return rate was highest on 3 West (75%) and lowest on 3 South (41.94%). The  demographics show that gender was basically the same on all three units, with 3  South having the fewest males. Reviewing age, 2 South had the highest  percentage of staff members age 40 and over (51.9%), compared to 23.1% on 3  South and 37.1% on 3 West. Education levels varied between units; 3 West had  the highest number of BSN and higher-prepared nurses (55.6%), compared to 2  South at 48.1% and 3 South at 30.8%.</li>
  <li>3  West, which has the most active UPC, scored the highest in all five factors. The  most significant was the Unit Culture. 3 West scored 4.1, compared to 2 South  at 3.43 and 3 South at 3.91. This indicated that the activities of the UPC and  nursing leadership are promoting an environment that is supportive of evidence-based  activities.  </li>
  <li>2  South had the lowest score for Unit Culture 3.43. This unit has an active UPC,  but based on the score it appears that evidence-based practice is not as  supported on the unit. One possible reason for this could be the experience  level on 2 South. 2 South has 33.3% of registered nurses with 20-plus years of  experience as a registered nurse, compared to 7.7% on 3 South and 7.4% on 3  West. Nurses with 20-plus years of experience may not have studied EBP as part  of their educational preparation. The number of  nurses in school is also the lowest on 2 South, 7.4%, compared to 23.1% on 3  South and 18.5% on 3 West. These may also contribute to the lower Unit Culture  scores.</li>
  <li>Scores  for 3 South, which had the least active UPC, were between those of 2 South and  3 West; however, it should be noted that 3 South&rsquo;s scores tend to be closer to  3 West than to 2 South.</li>
  <li>2  South has the lowest scores for Time, 2.79, compared to 3.15 on 3 West. The  questions in the Time factor are: 1. Nurses have enough time on the job to  implement evidence-based practice findings and 2. I could find one hour per  week on the job for evidence-based practice activities if I made it a priority.  The scores make it evident that 2 South feels that the lack of time is a major  factor in the unit not being as knowledgeable and supportive of evidence-based  practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implications of the Findings</strong><br>
  There are  two major implications of the findings. One is that the stronger the UPC, the  more active use of evidence-based practice is on that unit. This was determined  by a subjective assessment of the researchers. The researchers knew that 3 West  had the most active UPC and provided the most evidence-based practice of the  three units studied. It was assumed that they would have the highest scores. It  is interesting to note that the unit with the lowest scores has the second most  active UPC, which was not what the researchers were hypothesizing. </p>
<p>The  researchers believed that 2 South would score the second highest based on the  activity of the UPC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other  interesting finding was that the organization culture for evidence-based  practice was lower than the unit culture. This must be studied further, as nurses  must feel supported by the organization in their use of EBP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These  results will be shared with the units involved to give them a better understanding  of the use of evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impact for the Organization</strong><br>
  Based on  the results of the study, the following interventions will be instituted by  nurse leaders for the inpatient nursing units of Beaumont Grosse Pointe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review  evidence-based practice ideas and suggestions in a future nursing education  session</li>
  <li>Review  the results with the 2 South UPC and have Nursing Education develop a plan on  how to increase knowledge regarding evidence-based practice</li>
  <li>Highlight  3 West&rsquo;s successful UPC model and encourage other units&rsquo; UPCs to benchmark with  3 West to implement best practices</li>
  <li>Encourage  and support 3 South&rsquo;s continued development of its UPC</li>
</ul>
