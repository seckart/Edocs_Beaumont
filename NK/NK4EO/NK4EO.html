<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: An Innovative Way to Decrease Falls on 3 West – All Hands On Deck</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  At Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), a Quality  Care Patient Care (QCPC) meeting is held on the fourth Monday of every month  with the inpatient nursing leaders. Patricia Ackley, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse  Manager, 3 West, and Molly Brieden, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, 3 West, were  in attendance when the quarterly data was presented and discussed. Total  patient falls per 1,000 patient days was discussed because falls can cause  serious harm to patients, increase patients&rsquo; length of stay, increase cost and  affect patient satisfaction<em>. </em>BGP  takes falls seriously because of their negative consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the March 2015 QCPC meeting, the  NDNQI fall data for fourth quarter 2014 was reviewed, and it was determined  that 3 West had a high fall rate. 3 West is a medical/surgical unit that  focuses on GI/GU disorders. The data revealed that the unit&rsquo;s fall rate for  fourth quarter 2014 was 4.12 (total falls per 1,000 patient days). It was  apparent that 3 West nurses would need to  develop an action plan to decrease the number of falls on the unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3 West patient population tends to  be older, which brings numerous comorbidities that can contribute to the  effects of Sundowner&rsquo;s Syndrome, which increases the likelihood of falls. Sundowner's Syndrome is the name given to an ailment  that causes symptoms of confusion after &ldquo;sundown.&rdquo; These symptoms often appear in  people who suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. 3 West takes many postoperative  GI/GU patients, so postoperative confusion can be another factor in patient  falls. These two factors alone can put this patient population at high risk for  falls. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a patient is at high risk for  falls, the clinical nurse requests a patient safety sitter from the Nursing  Business Office (NBO). A safety sitter is an employee who will sit at the patient&rsquo;s  bedside and assist them with any daily needs that might put them at risk for  falls, especially toileting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To request a sitter, the clinical nurse assesses  the patient and completes a sitter justification form to fax to the NBO. The  form requires the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demographics</li>
  <li>Indicators  for Restraints: Safety, Behavioral, Suicide, Physician Order</li>
  <li>Authorization  from Leader</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NBO plans for and attempts to secure  staffing for patient safety sitters to fill the unit&rsquo;s needs to ensure patient  safety which can, in turn, result in less falls. The process for requesting a  patient safety sitter must be gone through every shift. If the NBO is not able  to secure a sitter during the middle of the shift, it notifies the charge nurse  and the staff checks on the patient frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the sitter was unavailable for the  entire shift, it would be determined at the beginning of the shift whether a nursing  care assistant (NCA) could be pulled out of staffing to sit with the patient. However,  pulling an NCA out of staffing shorted the unit and potentially put other patients  at risk of falling. The charge nurse was therefore put in the position of  deciding which action to take, pulling the NCA to be a safety sitter or  continuing with the NCA in the staffing mix. Given this situation, 3 West  recognized the need for change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the total patient fall rate on 3 West,  measured as total falls per 1,000 patient days. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  In April 2015, Brieden and Ackley discussed  the fall data with the 3 West staff during daily huddles and individually with  the clinical nurses and NCAs.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An innovative idea was brought forth during  a morning safety huddle by Maxine Griffith, BSN, RN, clinical nurse, 3 West.  The morning safety huddle is a short meeting led by Ackley and Rowena Angeles,  RN, Care Manager, in which the staff is debriefed on any safety issues on the  unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of Griffith&rsquo;s innovative idea was  to reduce patient falls while keeping the NCA in the staffing mix to prevent  other patients from falling. Griffith suggested that, instead of the current  practice of pulling a staff member off their patient assignment to have them  sit with the patient, the patient safety sitter responsibilities would be  divided among all the clinical nurses and NCAs working on the unit that shift. Each  staff member would then take 30 minute turns sitting with the patient to help  prevent falls.  Griffith had read about a  similar approach to covering safety sitters when an NCA was not available. Her  proposal innovated on this concept by ensuring that all nursing staff members  take a turn siting with patients, thereby raising their awareness of the  importance of ensuring patient safety. This plan promoted safety for all patients  on the unit by ensuring adequate nursing staff to provide care.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research demonstrates that if all staff members  are aware of a safety issue such as patients at high risk for falls, the less  likely it is the patient will fall. The innovative project was termed the &ldquo;All Hands On Deck&rdquo; (AHOD) approach to reducing the  number of falls on the unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 2015, after the All Hands on  Deck process had been developed, Brieden and Ackley decided to pilot it for 30  days on 3 West to determine its impact on the unit&rsquo;s patient fall rate  according to the NDNQI data. Brieden developed a form for assigning the staff  members&rsquo; scheduled time to sit with the patient and for identifying who their  coverage is for the time they are sitting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The form has a large clock on the top  half to show when staff members are scheduled to sit and an area on the bottom  half to designate staff coverage. It was decided that each staff member would  be assigned a 30-minute slot in which they are expected to watch the patient to  keep them from falling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the staff member sitting, another  is assigned to assume the care of the sitter&rsquo;s patient set. It was the  responsibility of the outgoing shift&rsquo;s charge nurse to fill out the AHOD clock  and make out the coverage schedule for the on-coming shift. The schedule was to  be made out at the beginning of the shift so the clinical nurses and NCAs could  manage their time accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expectation was that the staff  sitter would not leave the patient&rsquo;s bedside until the next person was there to  relieve them of their duty; there would then not be a moment without a staff member  at the bedside. To remind staff members of the time they were scheduled to sit,  the clinical assistant was given a copy of the AHOD and the form was placed in  the nursing stations, the break room and the patient room. </p>
<p>The program was fully implemented on 3  West by the end of third quarter 2015. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the success of the pilot, the  rest of the BGP nursing staff on all units were educated on AHOD during staff  meetings and one-on-one conversations with the unit managers. The clinical  assistants were given the form and educated on the process at the beginning of  their shift on the unit to begin the rollout. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Innovative Nursing Care in the Treatment of Sickle Cell Patients </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is close to  the urban area of Detroit, the population of which is predominantly African  American. Many of the hospitals in the city of Detroit either closed or were  converted to clinics in early 2013, which has led to an increase in the number  of sickle cell patients being seen in the BGP Emergency Center. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this same time, a lack of funding  resulted in the closing of a number of pain clinics that had been crucial in  managing the needs and medications of the sickle cell population. Because of  this sudden lack of support within the City of Detroit, many patients traveled  to surrounding hospitals for sickle cell symptom management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth quarter 2013, the BGP  Emergency Center began receiving an influx of these young, very sick sickle  cell patients. Although the symptoms of sickle cell disease are more easily  managed using a consistent proactive approach, many patients found themselves  with a lack of resources to do so. The closing of the clinics meant that many  physicians were no longer available for this vulnerable patient population, so  many patients who had been managed at the clinics were now finding themselves  in full blown sickle cell crises necessitating emergent care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The physicians and nurses in the Emergency  Center found themselves in unfamiliar territory, as most sickle cell patients  had previously been seen in an outpatient setting. The patients coming to the  Emergency Center were typically in sickle cell crisis, with the need for  hydration and opioids frequently requiring inpatient admission. The patients  were routinely admitted to the hospitalist on call, with no consistency in  physician coverage. The patient would be assigned to the physician who was on  call, and not necessarily to the physician who took care of them during their  last admission. In addition, when sickle cell patients were admitted they were  placed randomly in whichever unit had a ready bed, resulting in a lack of  continuity of nursing care When the patient was ready for  discharge, either from the Emergency Center or from the inpatient setting, they  were being discharged with no primary care provider (PCP).  BGP would give the patients a referral to a  PCP, but many did not follow up with a PCP because due to a lack of resources  such as insurance and transportation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the inconsistency in care  providers and the lack of outpatient resources, this population was not managed  across the continuum as effectively and efficiently as was desired. This  resulted in an increase in the 30-day readmission rate for this population.  During fourth quarter 2013, BGP had one of  the highest readmission rates for sickle cell patients for hospitals in the  University Health System Consortium (UHC) (now Vizient) database. BGP&rsquo;s fourth  quarter 2013 30-day readmission rate for sickle cell patients was 27.7%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the readmission rate for sickle cell patients,  as measured by 30-day readmissions<em>. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  In January 2014, a Sickle Cell  Subcommittee was formed. This was a nurse-driven effort to take the lead in  determining how to best handle this patient population. The members of the subcommittee  were nurse leaders, infusion nurses, oncology navigators, palliative care nurses,  educators, care managers and administration members.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 South Assistant Nurse Managers Pam  Lively, BSN, RN and Kim Little, BSN, RN agreed to champion this cause because  these patients had many needs, including the voice of the nurse to advocate for  them. Lively performed a literature review and learned that there was no  nursing evidence-based practice for decreasing the 30-day readmission rate for  sickle cell patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2014, Lively and Little  reached out to Tom Sullivan, RPh, Director of Pharmacy, and James Cherry,  PharmD, MS, Assistant Director of Pharmacy, to gain insight into this issue. Sullivan  informed them that the Pharmacy Clinical Integration Council (CIC) and the Pain  CIC had been working concurrently to develop and implement an innovative Sickle  Cell Order Set. The purpose of the Sickle Cell Order Set was to provide  consistent care across the Beaumont Health System to ensure that all patients with  sickle cell disease were receiving adequate relief for their pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tool was available but had not been  introduced or promoted to the medical staff. It was apparent that it was of  little value unless it was consistently used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Innovative  Approach to the Care and Management of Sickle Cell Patients</strong><br>
  During a March 2014 meeting of the Sickle Cell  Subcommittee, Lively and Little requested that all patients with the primary  diagnosis of sickle cell crisis be admitted to 2 South. This was an innovative and  unusual proposal. Lively, in discussions with other area hospitals and  hospitals within Beaumont Health System, identified that these patients were  often not cohorted on one unit due to the management issues involved with this  population The complexity of this chronic disease process and the need for  increasing doses of opioids for pain management often presents challenges for  nurses to provide the compassionate nursing care that had drawn them to the  profession. However, Lively recognized that cohorting these patients on one  unit would allow nurses to develop their expertise in the care of this patient  population and would also allow the full implementation of the new Sickle Order  Set.   <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To  support the care of this patient population, the Sickle Cell Order Set was  introduced to the nurses on 2 South through staff meetings and one-on-one discussions  with Lively and Little in March 2014. The clinical nurses were coached to  contact the admitting physicians to educate them on and encourage the use of  this order set. The nurses were also encouraged to provide copies of the order  set to the patients as a tool to educate them and involve them in the  management of their disease. Lively believed this would also strengthen the  nurse-patient relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late  March 2014, Lively, Little and the Sickle Cell Subcommittee determined that a  physician champion would be helpful to better facilitate the management of this  population. Alaa Mansour, MD was contacted and agreed to be the physician  champion. All sickle cell patients who presented to the Emergency Center  without a primary care physician would be admitted to Mansour.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2014,  Sandra Rizzo, MSN, RN, CEN, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Emergency Center and member  of the Sickle Cell Subcommittee, with the help of Glen Clark, MD, Director of  Emergency Center, began a campaign to improve the care and management of sickle  cell patients in the Emergency Center. Clark assumed responsibility for  educating Emergency Center physicians on the order set for inpatient  admissions. Rizzo was proactive in researching sickle cell disease and the  nursing care of these patients. She presented her findings through a slide show  to the entire Emergency Center staff, using a post test for clinical nurses to evaluate  the effectiveness of the presentation. This information was then shared with  the staff on 2 South.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April  2014, Charlotta Marion, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, Emergency Center, in  collaboration with the Informatics Department, developed a report to track patients  with a primary diagnosis of sickle cell crisis presenting to the EC and being  admitted from the EC to the inpatient unit. This report was sent daily to Marion,  Lively and Little, who were able to determine that the patients, if admitted,  had been placed appropriately on 2 South, that they had been assigned to  Mansour and that the order set was in use. Lively or Little subsequently followed  up to guarantee this consistent approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of second quarter, 2014, the  innovative approach to the care and management of sickle cell patients was  fully implemented. The comprehensive program included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All  patients without a PCP being assigned to Mansour</li>
  <li>All  patients being admitted to one unit, 2 South</li>
  <li>The  Sickle Cell Order Set being initiated on all patients </li>
  <li>Consistent  nursing staff</li>
</ul>
