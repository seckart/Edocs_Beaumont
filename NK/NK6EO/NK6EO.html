<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Emergency Center Work Flow Improvement for Clinical Efficiency – Decreasing  the Percentage of Patients Who Leave Without Being Seen </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse  Pointe (BGP) is a community teaching hospital with a 34-bed Emergency Center  (EC) that sees approximately 40,000 patients annually. Six of the 34 beds were designated  as Fast Track area beds, used during peak hours and staffed by an RN and  mid-level provider (MLP) who saw patients with minor conditions. The many  exclusion criteria for the Fast Track area, in addition to the presenting  complaint, included the patient&rsquo;s age, medical history and ambulatory status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was  clear to nurse leaders Steve Apigo, BSN, RN, Director of Emergency Center, and  Charlotta Marion, BSN, RN, Associate Nurse Manager, that the six beds in the  Fast Track area were being underutilized much of the time, and on most days  were empty. With a steady increase in patient volumes, over 20% from 2012 to  2015, the EC experienced an increase in the number and percent of patients who  left without being seen (LWOBS). Patients who leave the EC before seeing a  medical provider typically do so because of long waits. According to national  benchmarks, the LWOBS rate should be below 2%. Nurse leaders knew that decreasing  the LWOBS rate would require decreasing the amount of time it takes for a  patient to see a medical provider and begin treatment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apigo and  Marion solicited suggestions from the Emergency Center team of nurses and  physicians about how to adjust work flow to decrease wait times, with the goal  of decreasing the LWOBS rate and thereby improving clinical efficiency.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February  2015, the work flow for patients going to Fast Track and not requiring emergent  care was as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The  patient arrived and was greeted by an emergency technician or nurse.</li>
  <li>The  patient was asked the reason for the visit.</li>
  <li>Vital  signs were taken.</li>
  <li>Registration  was completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this  point, if a treatment room was available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  patient was brought to the treatment room where they were assigned a primary  nurse. </li>
  <li>The  patient waited to be examined by the physician or MLP, and orders were entered  in the electronic medical record (EMR). </li>
  <li>The  nurse or technician acknowledged the orders in the EMR and carried them out. How  fast the orders were carried out depended on a number of factors, including  patient volume and staff availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When all  the treatment rooms were full, the patient was sent to the waiting room after  the initial quick registration and triage to wait for the next available room.  This wait time was also dependent on volumes and available staff and  resources.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advance  Treatment Guidelines (ATG) are corporate policies, guidelines and standing  orders for nurses to begin some diagnostic testing and treatments based on  presenting symptoms, prior to the provider seeing the patient. The ATGs were  developed to improve throughput times in the EC and are used by nurses to move patients  more efficiently through the department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the ATGs were not being consistently  used by EC clinical nurses for a variety of reasons, such as duplication of  orders, physicians not supporting the ATGs and nurses&rsquo; lack of confidence in  using them. Apigo and Marion believed that use of the ATGs was the key to  successfully decreasing the LWOBS rate. The challenge was how to improve the  work flow so nurses would feel empowered to use the ATGs consistently.<br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apigo and Marion held discussions with the EC  staff, including clinical nurses, charge nurses, physicians and educators. The  consensus of the EC staff was that a more consistent use of ATGs would be the best  way to decrease wait times and thereby improve clinical efficiency, as measured  by a decrease in the LWOBS rate. The challenge was to develop a work flow  process to ensure the ease and consistent use of ATGs by clinical nurses. <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2015, the Emergency Center&rsquo;s LWOBS rate  was 3.54%, above the national benchmark of 2%.  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease  the rate of patients who left without being seen (LWOBS) in the Emergency  Center. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>April 2015–June 2015 </em><br>
  Apigo,  Marion and Brad O&rsquo;Shell, BSN, RN, Associate Nurse Manager, completed an assessment  of department work flow processes to identify areas for improvement. Various benchmarks  and data were reviewed, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Door  to physician </li>
  <li>Door  to diagnostics</li>
  <li>Door  to admit</li>
  <li>Left  without being seen</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marion, O&rsquo;Shell and Sandra Rizzo, MSN, RN CEN, Clinical Nurse  Specialist, completed the following to gather information about the work flow  design of the Emergency Center:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A  review of the literature to gather information for process improvement</li>
  <li>A  review of the Beaumont Health Emergency Centers, including their physical  layout, the patient flow process and how patients are admitted to the  department.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>July 2015: Work Flow Committee </em><br>
  A Work  Flow Committee was developed to find ways to improve the work flow in the area.  The committee included nursing leadership, charge nurses and volunteers from  the clinical nursing staff. It was also determined that physicians should be  part of the work flow design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After assessing  the current work flow, identifying areas of inefficiencies and discussing  options with clinical nurses, charge nurses, physicians and educators, the Work  Flow Committee decided to convert the Fast Track area of the EC to a hybrid  space. This area would be used for patient care, treatment and diagnostics,  using ATGs, before the patient is seen by the physician. The Emergency Center  Work Flow Committee, led by Marion, developed a plan with an algorithm of the  new work flow.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August 2015–September 2015: Design </em><br>
  The Work  Flow Committee&rsquo;s goal was to redesign the area to improve work flow. Based on  input from the committee, the following work flow changes were made to improve  efficiency:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Necessary  supplies and equipment were moved to the area, with clinical nurse input into  how the room was to be arranged and stocked for optimal work flow.</li>
  <li>The  area was to be staffed by three to four RNs and EC technicians.</li>
  <li>All  patients with an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score of 3, 4 or 5 would begin  the Emergency Department visit in the front end process.</li>
  <li>The  area was reconfigured so that patients who are ambulatory, wheelchair bound or  on a stretcher would receive a quick triage, nursing assessment and appropriate  diagnostic testing (ATGs), based on presenting symptoms.</li>
  <li>The  patient would then be transported to the main Emergency Department, where care  would be handed off to a primary nurse.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>October 2015: Education</em><br>
  All staff  members were educated on the new work flow design through change of shift  huddles, staff meetings, one-to-one meetings and emails from Marion, with the  goal of beginning the program in November 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>November 2015–January  2016: Implementation  </em><br>
  The new process began in November 2015. The  implementation phase was given to the charge nurses, who were available 24 hours  a day, seven days a week to assist with supplemental education and problem  solving. The following charge nurses were responsible for ensuring the process  ran smoothly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brooke  Meier, RN</li>
  <li>Beverly  Gandolfi, RN</li>
  <li>Joan  Shimko, BSN, RN, CEN</li>
  <li>Thomas  Difilippo, BSN, RN</li>
  <li>Sundare  Ganti, RN</li>
  <li>Anna  Welch, BSN, RN</li>
  <li>Kristen  Skoney, RN</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there was some resistance from the  clinical nurses, the EC leadership team decided that no changes would be made  during the first three months, giving time to accurately assess the strengths  and weaknesses of the change.<br>
  <br>
  <em>February 2016–March  2016</em><br>
  The process was evaluated after the three-month  implementation period, November 2015 through January 2016, with Marion gathering data such as LWOBS  rates and nursing staff input. The LWOBS rate was decreased, with fewer  patients leaving the EC prior to evaluation. Feedback from clinical nurses included  several suggestions for changes to the work flow, with the following  suggestions implemented by Marion and O&rsquo;Shell to improve the work flow of the  EC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform  vital signs upon entry rather than in the front end process.</li>
  <li>Provide  additional equipment such as computers on wheels and vital sign machines. </li>
  <li>An  additional RN was needed at the greeter desk acting as a Triage Care  Coordinator.</li>
  <li>The  entire Fast Track area should be used for the new work flow, rather than just a  portion of it, which was in the original plan.</li>
  <li>Patients  with a lower acuity (ESI 4 or 5), conditions not requiring them to disrobe and  conditions for which lab work is not expected to be necessary, would be placed  in designated hallway spaces in the main Emergency Department during times of  overcrowding.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By March 2016, all work flow improvements were fully  implemented. <br>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Following the interventions to improve clinical efficiency through the EC  Work Flow Committee&rsquo;s design, the rate of patients who left without being seen  decreased from 3.54% in March 2015 to  1.10% in June 2016. This improvement brought the rate to well below the  national average of 2%.</p>
