<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing  the HCAHPS Discharge Domain Score </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> <br>
  At Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), a customer service  meeting is held every Tuesday to review the HCAHPS scores for the previous week  and other issues related to customer service. The meeting is for all leaders  and clinical staff members from all areas of the hospital who are able to attend.  The February 17, 2016 customer service meeting included a discussion about the  low scores for the HCAHPS Discharge domain.   The participants determined that the data showed there was a problem  with the discharge process and work flow. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discharge paperwork, called the After Visit Summary  (AVS), was lengthy and complicated for both patients and the nursing staff, as  it typically consisted of six to10 printed pages for each discharge. This  paperwork was overwhelming for patients and family members, and it was difficult  to ascertain what was most important for the patient care needs after  discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there was no process in place to  provide patients with information on their primary diagnosis that they could  refer to at home. Many tools were available to the nursing staff, but there was  no single tool identified as the one to print for all patients at discharge. The  nurse would often talk with the patient and/or family members about the  diagnosis, but there was no clear expectation about what was most important for the patient after discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another concern was the number of calls that  patients or family members made in the evenings to the charge nurses and/or  Assistant Nurse Managers about the discharge instructions and medications. The  AVS was not clear about which medications the patient needed to take that day;  some nurses &ldquo;free-handed&rdquo; comments about this, while others did not. There were  no clear, basic instructions provided about medications. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the discharge process was examined more closely  during the customer service meeting, the participants identified that there was no consistent process on the day of  discharge. Discharge instructions were most often provided quickly with little  time spent at the bedside explaining the discharge and answering questions. The  nurses rarely took time with the patient and family to ensure that they had the  appropriate discharge education. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hospital&rsquo;s January 2016 HCAHPS score for the Discharge  domain was at the 6th percentile, meaning  94% of the hospitals in the Press Ganey database were doing better than BGP.  The Discharge domain consists of two questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>During this stay, did doctors, nurses or other  hospital staff talk with you about whether you would have the help you needed  when you left the hospital?</li>
  <li>During this stay, did you get information in writing  about what symptoms or health problems to look out for after you left the  hospital?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was clear that a plan was needed to improve, simplify  and bring structure to the discharge process and the education for the patient  and family.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To increase the HCAHPS Discharge domain score for  all discharged patients.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  On February 26, 2016, Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, convened an organization-wide group to improve  the discharge education for patients. The  group comprised leaders and bedside caregivers (from nursing, pharmacy, care  management and respiratory therapy, along with volunteers) to discuss the role  each of them played in patient discharge.   The role of the bedside caregiver is complex, and the team wanted to  find a way to simplify the patient discharge process for the healthcare team and  to increase the patients and family&rsquo;s knowledge regarding home care. Although a  clinical nurse is the last person to complete the discharge, many disciplines  impact the patient&rsquo;s preparation for discharge. This is why it was decided that  this program was beyond the scope of nursing, and that an organization-wide  change was needed to increase the patients and family&rsquo;s knowledge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this meeting, the organization-wide group  decided that discharge should be as &ldquo;simple as 1-2-3,&rdquo; so the program was  initially called Discharge 1-2-3; it has since been simplified to DC123. Representatives  from each specialty were asked to identify and bring to the next meeting three  items that they should complete and review with the patient and family member prior  to discharge. The representatives from each area were to speak with their staff  and bring their three items to the meeting on March 11, 2016. The plan was then  to begin the new process on March 30, 2016. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was determined through discussions with various  staffs that the disciplines of nursing, pharmacy, care management, respiratory  therapy and volunteers were responsible for the majority of the required discharge  teaching. To ensure that the discharge process was multidisciplinary, the  disciplines proposed that they be responsible for the following areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nursing:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Discharge instruction</li>
  <li>Medication information</li>
  <li>After Visit Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respiratory therapy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medication education</li>
  <li>Oxygen requirement</li>
  <li>Pulmonary plan at discharge</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Care management:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where is the patient going?</li>
  <li>How are they getting there? </li>
  <li>Plan at discharge</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pharmacy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What the medication is for</li>
  <li>How to use it</li>
  <li>Side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Volunteers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrive to room within 15 minutes of being called to  escort patient out</li>
  <li>Verify patient has discharge folder</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group held meetings on March 4 and 11, 2016 to  review the suggestions about what each specialty would be responsible to  complete. After the discussions at these meetings, the group developed a  checklist based on the input of all the disciplines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 28, 2016, the final checklist was approved  and education was provided. Stewart, in conjunction with the members of  multidisciplinary group, educated the caregivers on the new discharge process  to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education for the clinical assistants was completed  on March 29, 2016. The checklist was to be placed on the patient discharge  folder by the clinical assistant, and the checklist was  to remain on the discharge folder until the patient left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Discharge 123 program began on March 30, 2016. To  ease the process, the team decided that the folder was to be placed on the  bedside table so each discipline had access to the checklist and folder. The  goal was for each discipline to address and check off their items on the  checklist by discharge.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pharmacy provides a medication card with the first  dose of all new medications. The clinical nurse reviews the card with the  patient and family member before administering the first dose of medication,  and the card is then to be placed in the discharge folder.<strong></strong>At discharge, if the patient is not  going home on this particular medication, the clinical nurse discards the card. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an item from the checklist has not been completed,  the discharge RN will call for someone from that area to see the patient by the  time of discharge (contact numbers are on the checklist). The patient discharge  is not delayed, as someone will respond quickly. At discharge, the checklist is  placed in the basket at the unit desk by a staff members or volunteer.  <strong></strong></p>
