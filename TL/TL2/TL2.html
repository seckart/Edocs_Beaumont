<p><strong><em>Nurse  leaders and clinical nurses advocate for resources to support nursing unit and  organizational goals.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of a nurse leader's advocacy that resulted in the  allocation of resources to support an organizational goal.</em><br>
 <strong>AND</strong></p></li>
 <li><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of a clinical nurse's (or clinical nurses') advocacy  that resulted in the allocation of resources to support a nursing unit goal.</em></li>
 </ul>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Advocating for Resources to  Support an Organizational Goal – Increasing the Nurse Specialty Certification  Rate </strong><br>
  <strong> </strong><br>
  <strong>Organizational Goal</strong><br>
In 2015, Beaumont  Health set an overarching goal for all eight hospitals in the health system to develop  plans to obtain Magnet® designation within the next five to seven  years. Currently, two hospitals in the system have Magnet designation through  the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC): Beaumont Royal Oak and  Beaumont Troy. Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President, and Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, set an  organizational goal for Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) to achieve Magnet designation  by the end of 2018. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-1.pdf">(Evidence  TL2-1, Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe Operational Initative-2016)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Leader</strong><br>
  In September  2015, Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC was  hired as the Director of Professional Practice and Magnet Program Director  (MPD) for BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney  conducted a review of the various meeting minutes, reports and plans to gain insight  into BGP and identify any deficiencies in the pursuit of the organizational  goal of Magnet designation by 2018. Based on Whitney&rsquo;s previous experience as  an MPD, he knew that specialty certification is important for Magnet  designation and that a two-year plan  for increasing nursing certification must be identified and measured. He  noted that on October 15, 2014, the Nursing Clinical Integration Council discussed  a goal to increase the certification rate by 5% at the hospital and unit levels.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus  of the Nursing Clinical Integration Council is to set the direction and  strategic goals of nursing at BGP. Membership includes the  Nursing Director and CNO of all areas of nursing at BGP that report to the CNO.  Stewart&rsquo;s CNO update at the October 2014 meeting included BGP&rsquo;s progress toward  obtaining Magnet designation. Stewart knew from discussion with the CNOs at  Royal Oak and Troy that specialty nursing certification is a component of  Magnet designation, which requires that a goal be set to increase the number of  certified nurses. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-2.pdf">(Evidence  TL2-2, October 15, 2014 Nursing Clinical Integration Council Minutes)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney  reviewed the number of certified nurses and compared it to the number from  October 2014, and determined that the hospital and the Family Birth Center had  both exceeded the goal of 5% for 2014. Based on his review of the numbers,  Whitney determined that the certification rates would have to again increase by  5% by the end of 2015 for BGP to meet the organizational goal of Magnet designation.  Whitney determined that the 5% goal set by the Nursing Clinical Integration  Council in October 2014 was attainable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Leader Advocacy</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Getting buy in from key  stakeholders</strong></li>

<p>Whitney investigated  ways to increase certification at BGP and determined that the ANCC Success Pays  Program would assist in this. The ANCC Success Pays Program allows nurses to  take a certification exam up to two times without an upfront charge, and the  hospital is billed for only those nurses who pass the exam. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2016,  Whitney approached Stewart and Pandora Walker, Director of Human Resources  (HR), with a proposal to participate in the Success Pays Program. He stressed  the importance of increasing BGP&rsquo;s certification rate and that this program  would assist in achieving the organizational goal of Magnet designation. Whitney  developed a proposal for participating in the Success Pays certification  program, presented it to Stewart and Walker and gained their approval. Walker,  being new to the organization, wanted to verify  that BGP would be able to enter into this agreement since it would be an added expense  for the HR Department. It was proposed that the cost of the program be directed  to the HR budget, as HR was paying the expenses for nurses who obtain specialty  certification. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-3.pdf">(Evidence  TL2-3, Proposal for Success Pays Certification Program)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Making a Business Case</strong></li>

<p>By the end of January  2016, HR had not made a decision regarding the Success Pays Program. Whitney  approached Stewart and requested that the proposal be presented to the  Administrator&rsquo;s weekly meeting to obtain funding from BGP instead of HR.  Stewart supported the idea, and Whitney was added to the February 2, 2016  agenda to give an update on the Magnet Journey. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-4.pdf">(Evidence TL2-4, Agenda and Minutes of Administrator&rsquo;s Weekly  Meeting, February 2, 2016)</a> The meeting was attended by Swaine; Stewart;  Christine Stesney-Ridenour, MBA, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer;  Kristen Cavender, BSIE, MBA, CSSBB, Administrative Director; Robert Kilpatrick,  BSRS, RTR, Administrative Director; and Maria Miller, Controller BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney presented the  Success Pays proposal to the administrators, stating that is was necessary to  meet the organizational goal of obtaining Magnet designation. He reviewed the  following points of the proposal to ensure that they understood the importance  of the program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objective  – Increase certification rates.</li>
  <li>Background  – Why it is important to have certified nurses and the benefits of  certification.</li>
  <li>Summary  of Success Pays Program – It was stressed that nurses would incur no out of  pocket costs. One of the benefits of the Success Pays Program is that employees  do not have to pay up front, as BGP is billed once the nurse passes the  certification exam.</li>
  <li>Current  state at BGP – What nurses currently do to obtain reimbursement for  certification.</li>
  <li>Future  state at BGP – How the program will be implemented at BGP.</li>
  <li>Pros  and cons of the Success Pays Program.</li>
  <li>Cost  of the program – Whitney explained that the program cost would be approximately  $5,000 to $10,000. This would be based on the number of nurses who sign up for  the program, as BGP would only be charged for the nurses who pass the  certification exam.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Allocation of Resources</strong><br>
  Based on  Whitney&rsquo;s presentation, the administrators agreed to fund the Success Pays  Program for one year and determine the future direction at a later date.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On  February 16, 2016, Stewart signed a purchase agreement with the ANCC Success  Pays Program to begin enrolling nurses on March 1, 2016. The program was  finalized on February 18, 2016, and in early March Stewart distributed a memo  to all BGP nursing colleagues outlining the Success Pays Program and how to  access it. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-5.pdf">(Evidence TL2-5,  Success Pays Purchase Agreement, Invoices, Memo to Nursing Colleagues and Memo  on How to Access)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since  March 1, 2016, 10 nurses have registered for the Success Pays Program to sit  for a certification exam. Seven BGP nurses have successfully achieved specialty  certification, with the goal of a 5% increase in hospital certifications  achieved by the end of 2016 (see SE3EO). <br>
  <br>
  Whitney  successfully advocated for resources to increase certification rates at BGP in  support of the organizational goal of achieving Magnet designation. Without his  advocacy and the support of Hospital Administration, the Success Pays Program  would not be available to the BGP clinical nurses and nursing leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Advocating for Resources to Support  a Nursing Unit Goal – Permanent Charge Nurse on the Critical Care Stepdown Unit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nursing Unit Goal</strong><br>
  Patients  and their families are the heart of Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), and nurses at all levels are dedicated  ambassadors in providing &ldquo;compassionate, extraordinary care every day.&rdquo; Clinical  nurses are empowered to be advocates in identifying resources needed to provide  this extraordinary care. Critical Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU) clinical nurses  identified and advocated for a resource need of improved daily clinical support  and staffing to support the unit&rsquo;s goal of providing compassionate,  extraordinary care. This translated into the  development of a permanent charge nurse role to support the resource need  requested by clinical nurses. It was announced at the April 2014 staff meeting  that the team leader position for nights was open, and  the clinical nurses began to discuss the idea of a permanent charge nurse. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-6.pdf">(Evidence TL2-6, Critical Care  Stepdown Unit Staff Meeting Minutes)</a> The idea of the permanent charge nurse was discussed further  in the Unit Practice Council on May 28, 2014. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background </strong><br>
  In March  2014, clinical nurses Jennifer Sams, RN; Edna  Kouzoukas, RN; Theresa Lopez, RN; Janet Szewczyk, RN; and Michelle Urben, RN took  the initiative to voice concerns to Susan Wolka, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse  Manager (ANM) CCSU, which led to the development of the permanent, daily charge  nurse role that has since been implemented house-wide. With increasing patient  acuity levels and shorter hospital stays, the role of the charge nurses has  become integral to optimal patient care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Nurses&rsquo; Advocacy</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Communicating the  need for Additional Resources to the ANM and Director through Unit Practice  Council and Staff Meetings</strong></li>

<p>In March 2014, CCSU clinical nurses began expressing their concerns regarding the need  for manager support in relation to the staffing matrix.  Several clinical nurses, including Sams, Kouzoukas, Lopez, Szewczyk and Urben, brought  this to Wolka&rsquo;s attention through verbal communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this time in  2014, CCSU used a &ldquo;T-Code,&rdquo; or charge nurse, on days when the ANM was not  scheduled to work. This was generally one day per workweek and on weekends and  holidays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On  May 28, 2014, the CCSU Unit Practice Council (UPC) invited Wolka and Marie Reinman,  RN, Director of Critical Care and Heart/Vascular, to the meeting to discuss the  T-Code/charge nurse. Specifically, the UPC asked whether the T-Code/charge nurse  should have a patient assignment when the ANM is at work, and for clarification  of T-Code responsibilities. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-7.pdf">(Evidence TL2-7, Unit  Practice Council Meeting Minutes, May 28, 2014)</a> At that time, it was  determined that the &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; charge nurse would take a light patient  assignment to help facilitate the requirements of the floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<p>Around the same time, clinical nurses had been expressing in staff meetings, safety huddles and open door  communication with Wolka that a daily charge nurse rather than the &ldquo;as needed&rdquo;  charge nurse would be beneficial to the unit. The clinical nurses also  said that a charge nurse with an assignment, even on days when an ANM is  present, was not as advantageous to their needs, as  it could possibly become overwhelming for the clinical nurses. Wolka believed  that her role as ANM had been evolving into more of an administrative role, in  which her clinical support to nurses was not  always available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCSU clinical nurses said that  they believed a daily charge nurse without a patient assignment would provide a  critical clinical resource for when they needed support in delivering expert,  competent care. Other benefits of the daily charge nurse perceived and expressed by CCSU clinical nurses included  improved patient care experience, increased clinical nurse job satisfaction,  mediation and improved service recovery, and a resource for mentoring new  nurses to decrease the nurse turnover rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clinical Nurses  Advocating for Additional Resources with the CNO</strong></li>

<p>In June 2014, Wolka  and Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BE, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, held a Nursing Leadership  Forum (NLF). NLFs provide an opportunity for clinical nurses to spend time with  ANMs, Nursing Leaders and the CNO to discuss topics that require attention and  what is working well. The NLF meeting dates and times are posted for every  employee on the unit to see, and all are welcome to attend. Stewart encourages  clinical nurse advocacy and the expression of thoughts and concerns by staff members,  while using the opportunity to share specific unit/hospital information. As breakdowns  in communication are the most common root of problems, it is imperative to engage in open and honest communication throughout the  year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the June 2014 NLF meeting, CCSU  clinical nurses said that a permanent daily charge nurse, instead of the &ldquo;as needed&rdquo;  charge nurse, would support their professional practice and allow them to enhance  the delivery of patient and family centered care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Using Culture of  Safety Scores to Advocate for Additional Resources</strong></li>

<p>In June 2014, CCSU nurses  participated in the Culture of Safety (COS) survey that is administered yearly  by Beaumont Health. The results of the COS survey, which were shared with  nurses at a meeting on August 4, 2016, echoed the concerns  that clinical nurses had previously expressed to Wolka, Reinman and Stewart.  Through the COS survey, the CCSU nurses requested  more support with staffing, help in retaining new employees and to engage  &ldquo;seasoned-experienced&rdquo; staff, ensuring the delivery of high-quality care to patients.  The COS meeting emphasized that a charge nurse needed to be assigned on the day  shift, even when the ANM is working. ANMs expressed that there were too many interruptions  of their daily leadership tasks, which they believed resulted in them not being  able to adequately engage in the clinical aspects of their position. These  included staff coaching, the prompt handling of difficult patient situations, always  being available to support the staff when a Rapid Response or Code CPR is  called, collaborating with physicians and other disciplines on daily rounding, adequately  assisting in the regulation of the flow on the unit and adequately leading the  staff. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-8.pdf">(Evidence  TL2-8, Summary of Inpatient Nursing Leadership Culture of Safety Meeting-CCSU  August 4, 2014, Attendance Sheet and Culture of Safety Action Plan)</a></p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Allocation of Resources – Three Month Trial of  Charge Nurse Role</strong><br>
  Based on the clinical  nurses&rsquo; advocacy, Wolka held a verbal discussion with  Stewart in August 2014 and obtained permission to trial a daily T-Code/charge  nurse. Stewart subsequently told Wolka that she would allocate resources to  adjust the staffing matrix to reflect the T-Code/charge nurse for a trial of  three months. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 4, 2014, the staffing matrix for CCSU was updated to reflect  the inclusion of a charge RN. The three-month trial of a daily charge nurse was  communicated to the staff at the CCSU staff meeting in September 2014.  Guidelines for the dayshift charge nurse were developed at this time, outlining  the general responsibilities assigned to this role. The three-month trial of  the daily charge nurse (September–November  2014) proved successful. Feedback on the permanent  charge nurse trial given during CCSU leadership discussions on October 3, 2014,  showed that the staff was seeing improvements. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-9.pdf">(Evidence TL2-9, Pre-Post Staffing Matrix CCSU, September  2014 CCSU Staff Meeting Minutes and Guidelines for CCSU Charge Nurse)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another COS survey was completed in December 2014, with the CCSU staff  communicating that a daily charge nurse without a patient assignment was a &ldquo;big  need&rdquo; that had been filled. With the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the  trial and the advocacy of the clinical nurses, Stewart allocated resources for  the indefinite continuation of the trial. Stewart also allocated additional  resources to allow other units to trial the use of a permanent charge nurse.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Participation in Budget  Process</strong><br>
  The trial was completed on CCSU in February 2015. The trial had continued  to show the overwhelmingly positive impact of the permanent charge nurse on the  clinical nurses&rsquo; goal to have a charge nurse without patients that they had  advocated for.  Stewart set into  motion the fiscal appropriations to support the hiring of four permanent charge  nurses on CCSU and on other units as staffing dictated. It was believed that  dedicated, permanent charge nurses would be ideal in supporting the continued  goals of BGP. The CCSU charge nurse position was posted on April  6, 2015. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviews with the four CCSU charge nurse candidates were held on April  20, 2015. Andrea Carstens, BSN, RN; Michelle Urben, RN; Theresa Lopez, RN; and  Shelly Jennings, RN were all internal  candidates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  interviewing panel included Wolka and clinical nurses Lianne Pounders, RN and Christine  Cooper, RN. The candidate interviews included  questions regarding their personal leadership characteristics. After the  interviews, the interview panel of peers determined that all four would be  offered positions as permanent charge nurses, officially starting in May 2015. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL2-10.pdf">(Evidence TL2-10 Posting, Interviewing Tools and  Assignment Sheet for Charge Nurse)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Success of Clinical  Nurses&rsquo; Advocacy for Permanent Charge Nurses</strong><br>
  Since the implementation of the permanent charge nurse positions, the  results and feedback about the role have been continually positive. The COS  reports for CCSU continue to be positive, showing that the charge nurse role  has affected the overall perception of teamwork, promotion of patient safety,  continuous improvement, openness of communication and with teamwork with other  units</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staff  comments about having a charge nurse without patients have been positive. For  example, Kristine Palffy, RN stated that she appreciates the charge nurse role  in helping her provide exceptional care and that she always knows that the  charge nurse &ldquo;has her back&rdquo; and advocates for the needs of CCSU. Other staff  comments reaffirm that the role of the permanent charge nurse has been an added  value not only to the clinical nurses, but also to nursing leaders and the  entire organization. Most importantly, it supports the Beaumont Health goal of  providing &ldquo;compassionate, extraordinary care every day,&rdquo; the heart of why we  all do what we do for our patients.
