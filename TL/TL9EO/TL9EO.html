<p><strong>Example  One: Patient Experience – Communicating with the Patient and Family Regarding  Delays in Scheduled Patient Surgery</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Customer service scores hold great importance to Surgical Services clinical  nurses, with the Press Ganey™ patient satisfaction scores posted in staff break  rooms and in the Surgical Services showcase. Nurses frequently communicate  about these scores in staff meetings, and written communications include customer  service updates to emphasize the importance of every communication with customers,  including patients and their family and friends.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe&rsquo;s overall surgical volume has increased by 25% since  2012, and patient satisfaction is certainly a key factor contributing to this  growth.&nbsp;Surgical Services continue to strive for improvement, as there is  always an opportunity for greater customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurses in the surgical area engage in open communication  with nursing leadership, enabling them to express any concerns they have  regarding the care provided in the operating rooms. The goal isto  ensure that the patient experience is as positive as it can be.&nbsp;The most  efficient way to express concerns to nursing leadership is through the multiple  daily huddles that are held to review the activity of the day and to address  any issues clinical nurses are facing. The following huddles are held in the  surgical area:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0700 for the  Operating Room (OR) clinical nurses</li>
  <li>1000 for the  Interdisciplinary Huddle, which includes clinical nurses from Anesthesia,  Pre-Op, Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), Inpatient Surgery and Anesthesia Pre-screening  (APS)</li>
  <li>1300 Equipment  Huddle, attended by clinical nurse Service Line Coordinators, Material  Management and Central Processing Department</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone has a  voice, with all input is both valued and appreciated by Nursing Leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP Surgical Services comprises the following departments:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anesthesia Pre-screening  (APS)</li>
  <li>Anesthesia </li>
  <li>Pre-Op</li>
  <li>IP Surgery</li>
  <li>PACU</li>
  <li>Endoscopy </li>
  <li>Central Processing  Department </li>
  <li>Pain Clinic</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linda Witt, MA, BSN, RN, ONC, Director of Surgical Services, continually  brainstorms with nurse leaders and clinical nurses to explore ways to improve  the customer satisfaction scores in Surgical Services. Witt also meets monthly  with the BGP Customer Service Coordinators, Mary Kay Blaine and Maureen Bennett,  to discuss the scores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2013, one of the more common themes identified through  analyzing Press Ganey scores and reading patient comments was the opportunity  to improve upon managing the often unavoidable  delays that patients and families experience in the procedural environment.  During one of the customer service meetings in September 2013, Surgical  Services clinical nurses Kathleen Kastner, RN and Christina Spencer, RN spoke  with Witt and Administrative Managers Deborah Jankowski, BSN, RN and Roz  Talampas, BSN, RN about improving communication with patients and families. The  clinical nurses said that many variables skew the daily schedule, and delays  are often unavoidable.&nbsp;While the APS nurses do a good job of setting the  expectation that delays often occur when they speak with patients on the  telephone before the day of surgery, patients were still giving negative  responses for the Press Ganey questions regarding &ldquo;Communication with Patients  and Families.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kastner and Spencer discussed what more could be done to increase patients  and families&rsquo; satisfaction with communication, and the idea of providing a  communication update every 30 minutes was suggested. Kastner and Spencer discussed  this idea with Witt and Ruth Roberts, MSN, RN, CPAN, Education Specialist, during  a huddle in September 2013,and everyone agreed this would be a good  practice to implement and maintain.&nbsp;Witt suggested having volunteers help  with this initiative.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth quarter 2013 (October–December 2013), Surgical Services&rsquo;  Press Ganey patient satisfaction score for &ldquo;Information about delays&rdquo; was 60%.  This score measures the percentage of patients/families responding &ldquo;always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To increase Surgical Services&rsquo; Press Ganey score for the question, &ldquo;Information about delays.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>January 2014</em><br>
  During a 10 a.m. interdisciplinary daily  huddle, Witt presented Kastner  and Spencer&rsquo;s idea of rounding on patients and families to keep them informed  about any delays in their procedure and informing them that they will be communicated  with every 30 minutes. Witt explained the importance of communicating with  patients and families regarding delays in the surgical schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of 30-minute rounding was discussed in the  daily huddles for the next two weeks. After much discussion, Witt decided that  the Pre-Op nurses would be responsible for keeping the patients and families  apprised of any and all delays.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witt recruited some of the more experienced Pre-Op  nurses to begin the process of informing patients and families of any delays in  their procedure every 30 minutes. The following nurses agreed to take part in  the initial training; Barszczowski, Carson, Cesarz, Duby, Dyarcsyk, Halter,  Moses, Revenberg and Slocum.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When discussing the process, the Pre-Op clinical  nurses suggested that the APS clinical nurses should explain that surgical delays  occur periodically, but that communication will be ongoing to keep the patient  and family informed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February 2014 </em><br>
  Witt enlisted Roberts&rsquo; help to educate the PACU and APS clinical nurseson the new process for keeping the  patient and family informed of delays in their surgical procedure. The  following topics were discussed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review Press Ganey  scores regarding delays</li>
  <li>Discuss ways to  improve care</li>
  <li>Explain ways to  communicate delays to patients and families</li>
  <li>Set expectation of  delays when APS calls the patients</li>
  <li>Explain the delay  to the patient and family</li>
  <li>The importance of  communicating with family every 30 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March 2014</em><br>
  The new process of keeping patients and families  informed every 30 minutes of any and all delays in their procedure was implemented smoothly. Witt monitored  compliance to ensure that patients and families were kept up to date every 30  minutes.The nurses would monitor the scheduled  procedure time to ensure that updates were provided.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the implementation phase of this change, the  clinical nurses began using one of the volunteers who monitor the surgical  waiting room. Bettye Wright, RN, a retired nurse who was very supportive of  patient and family communication, would assist the Pre-Op nurses with  communicating with patients and families to keep them informed.  <br>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
Clinical nurses&rsquo; communication to a nurse leader resulted in improved  patient satisfaction scores related to communication. Surgical Services&rsquo; score  for the question, &ldquo;Information about delays&rdquo; increased from 60% for October–December  2013 to 74% for April–June 2014, 82% for July–September 2014 and 66% for October–December  2014.<strong> </strong>

<p align="center">Evidence TL9EO-1 Press Ganey Percentile  Ranking Question in Surgical Services:  <br>
  Information About Delays</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Change in Nursing Practice: Eliminating Look-Alike Sound-Alike Medications in the Endoscopy Pyxis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  One of the procedure rooms in Endoscopy that is infrequently  used for bronchoscopies had to be set up for this procedure, which is performed  only six to seven times a month. Since this is an infrequently performed  procedure and all clinical nurses need to maintain their skills, they have chosen  to rotate through the area. With this process, it is very likely that each  clinical nurse performs only one bronchoscopy case every two to three months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 10, 2016, a patient was scheduled for a  bronchoscopy in the Endoscopy room that is infrequently used for this.When the  patient arrived for the procedure, the order was to give Versed 4mg IV push. When  M.C., BSN, RN, Endoscopy clinical nurse, went to retrieve the Versed from the  Pyxis® machine, she typed the letters &ldquo;ver,&rdquo; selected the  medication, removed it and administered it to the patient.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As M. C. was wasting the remaining medication, she noticed  that she had selected and administered 4 mg of Verapamil instead of Versed. She  immediately notified Stephanie Metcalf, BSN, RN, Charge Nurse for the shift, and Sandy Montgomery, BSN, RN, Administrative Manager. Montgomery  notified Linda Witt, MA, BSN,  RN, ONC, Director of Surgical Services, and Robert Marchese, MD, Chief of  Medicine. The patient was taken to the endoscopy recovery area and examined by Cardiology.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure and recovery period and  was transferred to the Critical Care Stepdown Unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A review of the Pyxis determined that entering &ldquo;ver&rdquo;  auto selects two medications, Verapamil and Versed, in alphabetical order. The  clinical nurse therefore needed to scroll down to click on the Versed. Being in  a rush, the nurse in this case chose the first selection after typing &ldquo;ver&rdquo; and  did not notice that it was the wrong medication until after it was given. The  combination of needing to set up the room and this not being a routine  procedure for the nurse may have caused the atmosphere to feel rushed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M.C. spoke with Montgomery at length regarding the  incident and suggested that the unit remove all medications that look alike and  sound alike from the Pyxis system to prevent medication errors. M.C. also  suggested reviewing all medications in the Pyxis and removing any that are not regularly  administered. Montgomery believed these were great suggestions, and she  informed M.C. that this error was going to be reviewed at a root cause analysis  (RCA) meeting, to which she would be invited. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 14, 2016, Montgomery held a special staff  meeting of Endoscopy clinical nurses to discuss the error. The following items  were covered:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>A description of the error</li>
    <li>A discussion of ways to prevent the error</li>
    <li>The importance of not rushing</li>
    <li>The importance of not allowing interruptions or  distractions</li>
    <li>A review of the five rights of medication  administration </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCA was held on March 22, 2016 and included  Operating Room nursing leadership, clinical nurses, the Director of Quality and  Safety, staff members from Quality and Safety,  and representatives from Medical Administration, Hospital Administration and Pharmacy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This incident resulted in a medication error rate of  1.53 per 1,000 doses administered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the rate of medication errors in Endoscopy  to 0 by addressing look-alike, sound-alike medications.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  The RCA team determined through the RCA that the  root cause of this error was medical management, specifically, two look-alike,  sound-alike medications stored in alphabetical order in the Pyxis machine. The  team encouraged Montgomery to work with the clinical nurses to recommend and  implement strategies to prevent this type of error from occurring again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following strategies were implemented in the  Endoscopy unit: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>April  2016</strong><br>
  On April 1, 2016, following the outcome of the RCA,  Montgomery used suggestions from the Endoscopy  clinical nurses to remove the following rarely used medications from the Pyxis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verapamil</li>
  <li>Ephedrine</li>
  <li>Digoxin<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Montgomery spoke with Beaumont University and had  the following four patient medication safety education modules added for all  Endoscopy nurses to complete within the next 90 days. These modules, which reinforce  the safe administration of medications, were assigned as a refresher for all  clinical nurses.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2016 Patient Medication Safety Lesson One 16076</li>
  <li>2016 Patient Medication Safety Lesson Two 16077</li>
  <li>2016 Patient Medication Safety Lesson Three 16078</li>
  <li>2016 Patient Medication Safety Lesson Four 16079</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Montgomery changed the practice of giving  IV push medications in the Endoscopy Suite. Whenever a clinical nurse in  Endoscopy is giving an IV medication in Endoscopy, it now requires verification  by two clinical nurses. The goal of this change in practice was to eliminate  any further medication errors in the Endoscopy Suite.</p>
