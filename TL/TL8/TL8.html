<p><strong>Example One: Change in the Nurse Practice  Environment – Increasing Staffing Based on Acuity<u></u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2  South (2S) Unit at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is a general medical/surgical  unit with a number of specialties embedded within it. The 2S scope of practice  states:<strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;2 South provides a  high quality of care for a patient population consisting of neurological,  pulmonary, hospice, oncology/hematology, and general medical diagnoses. The  focus of care involves our stroke, pneumonia, COPD, cancer, and sickle cell  patients.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unit  also has an eight-bed video monitoring unit that is used for patients with  mental status changes, dementia or general confusion and who are deemed re-directable  from a remote location at the unit desk. In addition to this challenging  patient type, 2S receives the majority of the patients who are transferred from  the cardiac stepdown unit. To improve patient flow, it is imrperative that  patients be removed from telemetry and transferred off the telemetry unit as  soon as they are removed from telemetry. 2S cares for a number of complex  patient types, and also experiences significant churn with patients coming and  going at a rapid pace. As BGP&rsquo;s volume has increased over the last three years,  the volume of patients and speed at which they move from the telemetry unit to  2S has increased substantially.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staffing  matrix created for 2S was based on benchmarks for a general medical/surgical  unit. Although 2S fits the definition of a medical/surgical unit, staffing has  been a challenge. The staff on 2S had voiced concerns about the workload in general  unit meetings and on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) culture of safety survey. The  matrix had been re-evaluated a number of times, but each time it was reviewed  the unit seemed to fit the benchmark for a medical/surgical unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar  to other healthcare organizations, BGP has worked hard to improve its patient  experience scores. One of the tactics it uses is to hold a weekly Service  Meeting at which Hospital Administration, including the Chief Nursing Officer,  Hospital and Nursing Leaders, clinical nurses and other staff members, review  the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health  Providers and System (HCAHPS) scores to identify actions to improve the patient  experience scores.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Communication with Clinical Nurses</strong><br>
  On December  15, 2015, one of the last Service Meetings of 2015, Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC,  NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer,challenged the clinical nurses and  hospital staff to identify the reasons that BGP was not able to meet its customer  service targets. Aaron Achatz, RN, clinical nurse from 2S, raised his hand and spoke  openly to the group about the challenges the 2S clinical nurses face on a daily  basis. He described a typical patient load and articulated what he, as a 2S  clinical nurse, faces on a regular basis. Achatz described the complex patient  needs and the challenges this presents to the clinical nurse due to the variety  of specialties involved, saying that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to be a specialist in  everything.&rdquo; He also spoke about the emotional needs of hospice patients and  their families, which he said were not always being met due to the demands  placed on the clinical nurses by the other patients they are caring for. Stewart  listened and assured Achatz that the 2S staffing matrix would be reviewed and  altered as necessary. Achatz was asked to be involved in the change process. <br>
  <br>
  After  this customer service meeting, Stewart and 2S Assistant Nurse Managers Pamela  Lively, BSN, RN, NE-BC and Kimberly Little, BSN, RN met with Achatz and the 2S clinical  nurses to encourage them to communicate with Stewart about what the 2S staffing  matrix should look like to improve the nurse practice environment. The staffing  matrix was appropriate based on the numbers and assumptions about the medical/<br>
  surgical  patient type, but according to the 2S clinical nurses it was not appropriate. Achatz  and the 2S clinical nurses communicated to Stewart their concerns about patient  and family acuity on 2S, and Achatz followed up after the meeting with an email  to Stewart clarifying and describing the challenges. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-1.pdf">(Evidence TL8-1, Service Meeting Agenda, Work Plan and  Attendance, December 15, 2015 and Memo from Achatz to Stewart dated January 12,  2016)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart asked Lively and Little to work with  Achatz to develop a proposal to increase staffing on 2 South, which would  decrease the nurse-to-patient ratio and improve the nurse practice environment.  Lively worked with Achatz to pull a group together to review and adjust the  staffing matrix based on what the clinical nurses believed they needed to  provide care. In attendance at the meeting were members of the Unit Practice Council,  including clinical nurses Timothy Pierce, BSN, RN; Annette Gipperich, RN; Emily  Gross, BSN, RN; and Michael Hoekstra, BSN, RN.  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the meetings with Achatz and the 2S clinical  nurses, Stewart met with Lively and Little and approved the proposed changes to  the 2S Unit Matrix to increase the RN-to-patient ratio to that recommended by Achatz  and his colleagues. Although this matrix was outside the benchmark for a  general medical/surgical unit, Stewart supported the change based on the needs  of the 2S patients and the need to improve the clinical nurse practice  environment. On January 12, 2016, Little sent the proposed revised matrix to  Stewart for final approval. The proposed changes made to the staffing matrix on  2 South provides for a maximum of four patients to each nurse. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-2.pdf">(Evidence TL8-2, Little Email with  Proposed 2S Staffing Matrix Changes)</a><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart asked Little whether Achatz and the 2S  clinical nurses had viewed and approved the new staffing matrix, and Little  said she would verify this before the matrix was officially published. Little subsequently  sent Stewart an email confirming that Achatz agreed with the new 2S matrix. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-3.pdf">(Evidence TL8-3, Little Email regarding  Clinical Nurse Approval of 2S Staffing Matrix)<br>
  </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 28, 2016, the new 2S staffing matrix  was submitted to the Nursing Business Office (NBO) for implementation into  practice. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-4.pdf">(Evidence TL8-4, New  2S Unit Staffing Matrix, January 27, 2016)</a><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although  the staffing matrix was adjusted, the reality was that it would take time for  the nurse leaders to hire and orient enough clinical nurses to meet this new  matrix. 2S&rsquo;s culture of safety survey results in June 2016 continued to reflect  staffing concerns, and the unit did not hit the target score of 66% for the overall  perception of safety. Multiple comments related to staffing were noted on the  survey. Although Stewart and nursing leadership were committed to staffing the  unit to the new matrix, BGP&rsquo;s overall patient volume was up and leaders could not consistently staff the unit to the new  numbers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little  and Lively continued to work on recruiting and orienting additional staff  members. Stewart, Lively and Little met weekly with Dana Ludwig, Nursing  Recruiter, and the matrix was fully implemented in July 2016 after all the  clinical nurses were hired and trained.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  clinical nurses&rsquo; practice environment was improved as a result of the  communication between Achatz and Stewart. With the increase in clinical nurse  staffing, the nurses were able to decrease the nurse-to-patient ratio on 2 South.  This enabled the nurses to provide more individualized care for the patients,  and it provided a more reasonable workload for the clinical nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  December 2016 culture of safety survey reflected an improvement in the overall  perception of safety on 2S, from 63% in June 2016 to 68% (above the target) in  December 2016, and the comments reflect the improvement in staffing. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/Tl8-5.pdf">(Evidence TL8-5, Culture of Safety  Scores)</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Example Two:</strong> <strong>Change in Patient Experience – Quiet  Time on the Critical Care Stepdown Unit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>History:  Communicating with Nurses</strong><br>
  In May 2014, Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RNC, NE-BC was appointed Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer of Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP). In June 2014, the inpatient Agency for Healthcare Research and  Quality (AHRQ) culture  of safety surveys were launched for the clinical nurses and ancillary staff on  the units. The AHRQ survey assesses the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Teamwork within the unit</li>
  <li>Supervisor/manager expectations  &amp; actions promoting safety</li>
  <li>Organizational Learning – Continuous  improvement</li>
  <li>Management support for patient  safety</li>
  <li>Overall perceptions of patient  safety</li>
  <li>Feedback and communication about  error</li>
  <li>Communication openness</li>
  <li>Frequency of events reported</li>
  <li>Teamwork across units</li>
  <li>Staffing </li>
  <li>Handoffs &amp; transitions</li>
  <li>Non-punitive response to error</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the culture of safety  survey that was administered in July 2014 showed many problems in the nurse  practice environment, demonstrating that something needed to be done. It was  clear to Stewart that she needed to visit the units and speak directly with  clinical nurses to better understand the struggles in the practice environment  and, most importantly, help solve them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart began holding regular Culture  of Safety meetings with clinical nurses on a weekly or biweekly rotation. These  were eventually renamed Nursing Leadership Forums, because in addition to being  used to discuss the culture of safety they provide a communication venue for  Stewart to hear directly from the bedside caregivers about the issues they face  daily. Stewart does not bring an agenda to these meetings, as they are meant to  be a truly open forum for clinical nurse-CNO communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure the voices of all staff  members are heard, Stewart meets on both the day and night shift on the same  unit on the same day. Following each meeting, Stewart gives the department  secretary notes on the meeting. These are put into a grid that is posted on the  unit so clinical nurses who bring forward a concern know how it is followed up.  This also allows those who were not present to see what was discussed and what is  being done about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessing  the Patient Experience</strong><br>
  As the nurse practice environment  improved over time, Stewart heard less about the work environment for the  clinical nurses and more about what was and was not working for patients. Clinical  nurses provided great ideas on what was needed  to improve the patient experience.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the May 27, 2015 Nursing  Leadership Forum (NLF), Stewart discussed the unit and hospital HCAHPS scores. Clinical  nurses often see unit scores, but do not understand them well. Stewart believed  these forums provided a great opportunity to help clinical nurses better understand  HCAHPS scores and to ask them for suggestions to improve patients&rsquo; experience  and the HCAHPS scores.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During NLFs on the Critical Care  Stepdown Unit (CCSU), Stewart spoke with clinical nurses about the &ldquo;Quietness&rdquo;  domain, and many questions were raised about the noise level on the unit. The  unit is a very busy telemetry unit with a lot of patient activity. Many of the  patients admitted from the Emergency Center are admitted to the telemetry unit  for a time and then transferred to a lower level of care on a medical/surgical  unit. All this activity makes for a somewhat chaotic practice environment for  the staff and a noisy environment for the patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart was discussing the patient  experience scores at the May 27, 2015 NLF when Devin Mahoney, BSN, RN, CCSU clinical  nurse, suggested the idea of instituting a quiet time for the CCSU patients  during mid-day so they can rest. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-6.pdf">(Evidence TL8-6, May 27, 2015 CCSU Leadership Discussion Points and  Sign-in Sheet) </a>Mahoney described quiet time to his co-workers as a  designated time of the day when the lights in the hallways are dimmed and the activity  on the unit subsides. Families and loved ones can still be present, but the  staff would try to work quietly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCSU staff members attending the  NLF supported trying the quiet time. Mahoney described it as a time during  which the patients could rest and be free from unnecessary distractions, which  would allow them to feel more relaxed and have a better experience on the CCSU.  The rest of the clinical nurses and nursing care assistants were supportive of  the idea but requested more information about  the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the conversation with  Mahoney, Stewart brought the idea of quiet time to the Model of Care meeting  (MOC) on June 1, 2015 with Nurse Leaders from all inpatient units in attendance.  Stewart discussed the idea with them, and they supported piloting the idea on  CCSU. Leaders of other units were also interested, but they were encouraged to  first see how it went on CCSU.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-7.pdf">(Evidence TL8-7, June 1, 2015 Model of Care Agenda and Meeting Minutes)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implementing  Quiet Time</strong><br>
  On June 16, 2015, Stewart brought  the quiet time concept proposed by Mahoney to  the Inpatient Service meeting with Mary Kay Blaine, Director Service Excellence  department. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-8.pdf">(Evidence TL8-8,  Email from June 16, 2015 regarding Quiet Tim</a>e) Leaders  were assigned to put a plan together and bring it back to Stewart and her  group. <br>
  <br>
  Stewart worked with Jan McGlone,  System Wayfinding/Signage Coordinator, to make professional quiet time signage for  the units. These were delivered to BGP on June 25, 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-9.pdf">(Evidence TL8-9, Email Signage  Regarding QUIET Signs are Ready, and Email Quiet Time Verbiage for Tent Cards  and Communications)</a> Mary Zoumot, Corporate Communication Specialist from  Beaumont Corporate Communications, was assigned to make tent cards to ensure the  patients and families were aware of what quiet time entails. <br>
  <br>
  The quiet time pilot began on CCSU in July 2015, with patients,  families and clinical nurses immediately making positive comments. The simple  step of turning the lights down not only allowed patients and families time to  rest, it also gave staff time to decompress during their very busy shifts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation  of Quiet Time</strong><br>
  As the success of quiet time was  clear from the start, all BGP inpatient units wanted to implement it to enhance  the patient experience. The units determined their own quiet times based on  their unique cultures and needs. Based on the success of quiet time on CCSU,  all BGP inpatient units instituted a designated quiet time beginning on July  27, 2015, with the times that the lights were dimmed based on each unit&rsquo;s  patient and staff needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change in the patient experience  was implemented as a result of a clinical nurse communicating with the CNO at an  NLF and the CNO using her influence to bring the concept to reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quiet  Time Improves the Patient Experience</strong><br>
  The implementation of the quiet time  has been successful in improving the patient experience at BGP. Its success is  measured using the Press Ganey™ HCAHPS score for the question, &ldquo;During this  hospital stay how often was the area around your room quiet at night&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results have been outstanding. In first  quarter 2015, before implementation, BGP ranked in the 28th  percentile for top box scores compared to the entire Press Ganey database. After  the implementation, BGP&rsquo;s ranking increased to the 37th percentile  in third quarter 2015, 44th in fourth quarter 2015 and BGP&rsquo;s highest  ranking of the 48th percentile in first quarter 2016. BGP has improved  the patient experience by providing a safe, quiet environment. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL8-10.pdf">(Evidence TL8-10, Press Ganey  HCAHPS Survey Results for Q1-2015, Q3-2015, Q4-2015 and Q1-2016) </a></p>
