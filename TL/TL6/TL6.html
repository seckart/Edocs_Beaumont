<h2>Advocacy and Influence TL6</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The CNO  advocates for organizational support of ongoing leadership development for all  nurses, with a focus on mentoring and succession planning.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of each of the following </em><em>activities:</em></li>
  <ul>
  <li><em>Mentoring or succession planning activities for clinical nurses</em><br>
  <strong>AND</strong></li>
  <li><em>Mentoring or succession planning activities for nurse managers</em><br>
  <strong>AND</strong></li>
  <li><em>Mentoring or succession planning activities for nurse leaders (exclusive of nurse managers)</em><br>
  <strong>AND</strong></li>
  <li><em>Mentoring or succession planning activities for the chief nursing officer</em></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Mentoring  for Clinical Nurses</strong><br>
Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) clinical nurses,  as well as nurse leaders led by Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, have identified a number of areas in which  clinical nurses benefit from mentoring, education and support. These areas were  identified through a variety of forums and through concerns brought independently  to Stewart or other leaders by clinical nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early 2015, the inpatient units at BGP  experienced an increase in census that required additional assistance with their  day to day operation. Stewart sought salary dollars to place charge nurses on  the larger inpatient units to have someone readily available to help with the  day to day operations of the units and provide direct support and mentoring to  the clinical nurses. These were not intended to be manager roles, but would  rather be clinical nurses who were not given a patient assignment so they could  assist with the &ldquo;churn&rdquo; of the unit and be available as mentors for clinical  situations such as a sudden change in a patient condition. As these roles  operationalized, there was concern that the charge nurses practiced differently  between units and even on the same unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this variation, nursing leadership  met in February 2015 and identified consistent expectations for the charge  nurses on all units. The managers solicited input from the charge nurses and  clinical nurses on the units to develop guidelines for the charge nurses. In  addition to support and mentoring, they identified responsibilities such as  monitoring for core measures, rounding on patients and troubleshooting patient  care issues. The lists of responsibilities were compiled into &ldquo;guidelines for  charge nurses.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-1.pdf">(Evidence  TL6-1, Guidelines for 2 South Charge Nurses) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the guidelines, questions about the charge  nurses&rsquo; role remained. Stewart held a number of conversations with the charge  nurses and realized there was something missing in this role. The charge nurses  are frontline clinical nurses who handle a variety of patient care issues. They  have an Administrative Manager as a resource, but they did not necessarily have  other resources, such as a peer to reach out too, because they did not know the  charge nurses on the other units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart spoke with a number of charge nurses in  spring 2015 and it became clear that they could benefit from mentoring and  support not only from the unit manager, but from one another. There was  interest in having regular charge nurse meetings so they could talk through  issues and concerns. Stewart saw these meetings as an opportunity to mentor the  charge nurses, and she set up the first charge nurse meeting for June 19, 2015. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring Activity:  Charge Nurse Role</strong><br>
  At the first charge nurse meeting, facilitated  by Stewart, charge nurses from various units and shifts came together to meet one  another and discuss issues. The first meeting focused on introductions,  including their unit, shift, background and immediate issues they may have. It  was clear that this group needed a regular forum in which to meet, network and  discuss issues that affect the operations of the unit. Stewart began mentoring  the charge nurses, and they discussed topics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  charge nurse role</li>
  <li>Boundaries  of the charge nurse role</li>
  <li>What  to do about employee issues</li>
  <li>Communication  methods</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart scheduled monthly meetings on the day  and time determined by the group. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-2.pdf">(Evidence TL6-2, June 19, 2015 Charge Nurse Team Meeting Minutes)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the December 2, 2015 meeting, Stewart  discussed with them the importance of the group being led by a charge nurse,  with secretarial support and mentoring from Stewart. Stewart discussed how she  would mentor the leaders by: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Assisting  with setting an agenda</li>
  <li>Giving  advice on how to run a meeting</li>
  <li>Explaining  how to invite guests to the meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group was asked for volunteers to lead the  team, and clinical nurses Michelle Urben, RN and Theresa Lopez, RN, both from  Critical Care Step Down, volunteered to co-lead. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-3.pdf">(Evidence TL6-3, November 4, 2015 and December 2, 2015  Charge Nurse Team Minutes and Committee Roster)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2016, Urben and Lopez became the co-leaders  of the charge nurse team meeting. Prior to the January meeting, Stewart met  with Urben and Lopez to mentor and assist them with preparing the agenda for  the first and second meeting. The charge nurses have since addressed issues and  challenges as a team. The clinical nurse co-leaders continue to successfully  lead this team and make positive changes in the work life of the clinical  nurses on their units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring Activities:  Clinical Nurse Attends Professional Practice Model Retreat</strong><br>
  To mentor and support Urben in her new role as  co-lead of the charge nurse group, in June 2016 Stewart invited Urben to attend  a two-day retreat hosted by Beaumont Health (BH) to identify the Professional  Practice Model (PPM) for nursing in the new system. Stewart believed this would  be a great mentoring opportunity, as Urben would be able to observe how to  effectively make changes. Stewart met with Urben prior to the meeting to  discuss what Urben should be observing and what she should bring back to BGP in  her role as a co-leader of the charge nurse group. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-4.pdf">(Evidence TL6-4, Attendance Sheet from Professional  Practice Model Retreat)</a> More than 300 nurses from the eight Beaumont  Health hospitals gathered to identify a PPM that represents the blended  cultures of BH hospitals. On the first day of the retreat, Christy Dempsey,  MSN, MBA, RN, CNOR, CENP, Chief Nursing Officer of Press Ganey Associates,  presented &ldquo;An Epidemic in Empathy,&rdquo; which focused on efforts to reduce patient  suffering and develop compassionate, connected care across the continuum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Stewart&rsquo;s mentorship in establishing  the charge nurse team meeting and appointing and supporting two clinical nurses  to co-lead the committee, the charge nurses became a very successful and  productive group.  The group continues to  meet monthly and has become an integral part of nursing leadership. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-5.pdf">(Evidence TL6-5, Charge Nurses  Meeting Minutes, February 2017)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Mentoring for Nurse Managers</strong><br>
  The opportunities available to help Nurse  Managers develop and grow include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Educational  assistance</li>
  <li>1:1  coaching and interviewing for new positions</li>
  <li>Leadership  training </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Obtaining Educational Assistance</strong><br>
  To improve the Nurse Mangers&rsquo; leadership  skills, and in recognition of the need for all Nurse Managers to obtain a BSN,  in May 2015 Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing  Officer, met with Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President, and Lisa  Ouellette, Director of Human Resources, about the number of Assistant Nurse  Managers (ANM) without a BSN. These leaders were valuable members of the Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) nursing leadership team. Stewart therefore, rather than  removing them from the role, lobbied for funding to supplement the tuition reimbursement  program for the ANMs to pursue a BSN degree as long as they completed it within  a shortened time frame, by December 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2015, Stewart met with each ANM  to discuss this proposal of enhanced educational assistance. For the six nurse  leaders who needed this, the agreement was that the hospital would provide  supplemental assistance of up to $12,000 toward a BSN, in addition to the regular  tuition assistance, as long as they completed the degree by December 31, 2016.  Alexis Rogers, RN, OCN, Assistant Nurse Manger, 3 South Orthopedic, express  interest in the program. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-6.pdf">(Evidence  TL6-6, Enhanced Educational Assistance Benefit Agreement)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers expressed her desire to grow and expand her role in the organization, and Stewart  suggested different activities she could engage in to improve her  marketability.  Rogers had been an ANM on  3 South for over 10 years and was unable to transfer because she did not have a  BSN degree. Stewart offered to provide mentoring to assist her in obtaining a  promotion once she obtained her BSN. Rogers accepted the educational assistance  and obtained her BSN in May 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: 1:1 Coaching Interviewing for New Positions</strong><br>
  Rogers approached Stewart about the  possibility of interviewing for the position of Administrative Manager of the  Internal Resource Team. Rogers explained to Stewart that, because she had been  on 3 South for so long, she was interested in expanding her role and knowledge  base. Stewart supported this idea since she knew Rogers&rsquo; ultimate goal was to  assume a director position and that Rogers had not interviewed for a position  in at least 10 years. Stewart assisted Rogers by discussing questions that  might be asked and ways to learn how to interview effectively. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-7.pdf">(Evidence TL6-7, Email June 27,  2016 Stewart Coaching Rogers)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Leadership Training</strong><br>
  The Beaumont Health Nurse Executive  Council, which Stewart is a member of, discussed the needs of the frontline  nursing leadership and decided to host a series of Advisory Board Leadership  Education sessions as a first step in leadership development. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the results of a gap analysis,  it was decided that the sessions would be offered exclusively to leaders at the  five southern hospitals of Beaumont Health. Stewart asked if BGP could send several  Nurse Managers to the leadership training, and she believed this would be a  great mentoring activity for Rogers based on their previous discussion. It was  agreed that BGP could send several leaders if  space were available. ANMs were being reclassified as Administrative Managers  (AM), and it was important to Stewart and her leadership team that, once this  was complete, the Nurse Managers and their staffs felt they were prepared for  this new role. Stewart secured spots in the leadership training for BGP, and  Rogers was able to attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers attended the leadership training, which  consisted of three four-hour classes held over five months. The topics  included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leading  Through Vision-Effective Decision Making and Meeting Long-Term Objectives</li>
  <li>Instilling  Accountability-Elevating Staff Performance</li>
  <li>Managing  Disruptive Behaviors – Creating a Healthy Workplace Culture</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-8.pdf">(Evidence  TL6-8, Workbook Leadership Training and Rogers&rsquo; Certification of Continuing  Education)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring Activity:  Leadership Skill Inventory</strong><br>
  To further prepare Rogers and mentor her in her  role, Stewart hosted a luncheon on November 8, 2016 and had all nurse leaders,  including Rogers, complete a Leadership Skills Inventory. </p>
<p> <br>
  The Administrative Managers used the Nurse  Manager Skills Inventory Tool ©2006, Nurse Manager Leadership Partnership  (NMLP), as a self-assessment tool to evaluate themselves in the following  competencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial  Management</li>
  <li>Human  Resource Management</li>
  <li>Performance  Improvement</li>
  <li>Foundational  Thinking Skills</li>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Strategic  Management</li>
  <li>Appropriate  Clinical Practice Knowledge</li>
  <li>Human  Resource Leadership Skills</li>
  <li>Relationship  Management and Influencing Behaviors</li>
  <li>Diversity</li>
  <li>Shared  Decision-Making</li>
  <li>Personal  and Professional Accountability</li>
  <li>Career  Planning</li>
  <li>Personal  Journey Disciplines</li>
  <li>Reflective  Practice Reference Behaviors/Tenants</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  these results and discussions at this session, it was decided, with Stewart&rsquo;s  support, that nursing leadership would meet once a month beginning in 2017 for  &ldquo;lunch and learns&rdquo; to provide education and  mentoring opportunities. The subjects for each session would be identified by  the Nurse Managers and Stewart based on needs and interest. On January 11,  2017, Rogers attended the first lunch along with other members of the nursing  leadership team. At this meeting, the group reviewed and discussed the results  of the Nurse Manager Skills Inventory survey. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-9.pdf">(Evidence TL6-9, Sign-in Sheet and Example of Nurse Manager  Skills Inventory Tool and CE Certificates)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Beaumont University Leadership Courses</strong><br>
  Beaumont Health offers an array of leadership  courses for anyone who is promoted or hired into a nurse leader role in the  health system. Many leadership courses are available through BH&rsquo;s continuing  education department, Beaumont University, and they are offered at no cost to  employees. Stewart suggested to Rogers that she should review the courses available  and attend those that she thought were appropriate. The following are the  Leadership Development courses offered to leaders in 2016:</p>
<ul>
  <li>7  Habits of Highly Effective People</li>
  <li>Becoming  a More Effective Leader:  Understanding  Your Management Style</li>
  <li>Crucial  Conversations</li>
  <li>Emotional  Intelligence</li>
  <li>Employee  Relations Skills</li>
  <li>Influencer</li>
  <li>Leadership  Essentials</li>
  <li>Managing  Toxic and Disruptive Behaviors</li>
  <li>The  Attitude Angel</li>
  <li>Overcoming  The Five Dysfunctions of a Team for Leaders</li>
  <li>Generations  in the Workplace</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 19, 2017, Stewart sponsored  all BGP Nurse Managers, including Rogers, to attend a leadership conference, &ldquo;Taking  the Lead 2017: Leading Systems, Others and Self,&rdquo; held in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Stewart  recognized that this conference would be an opportunity to provide additional  mentoring to Rogers and the Nurse Manager group. The agenda covered a variety  of subjects that are pertinent to Nurse Managers, including &ldquo;Adapting Systems  of Care for Diverse Populations,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Importance of Leaders at the Front-line&rdquo;  and &ldquo;The Emerging Role of the Clinical Nurse Leader.&rdquo;<br>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-10.pdf">(Evidence TL6-10, Brochure  Taking the Lead 2017: Leading Systems, Others and Self Conference and CE  Certificate) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Stewart&rsquo;s mentoring and support,  Rogers was promoted to Administrative Manager of 3 South Orthopedic Unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Three:  Mentoring for Nurse Leaders (Directors/Administrators)</strong><br>
  Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, provides mentoring to all Nurse Directors  through one-on-one counseling and discussions and by providing educational  opportunities. Beaumont Grosse Pointe&rsquo;s (BGP) Nursing Directors were included  in the education, programs and leadership survey used to guide the development  of the Nurse Managers. These leaders actively participated in the Advisory  Board sessions to build the knowledge and skills needed to enhance their performance.  Nurse Directors networked and collaborated throughout the sessions, and they  obtained tools and techniques to maximize the effectiveness of their role. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Apigo, BSN, RN, Director of  Emergency Center, provides one example of Stewart&rsquo;s mentoring and support for Directors.  With Stewart&rsquo;s guidance and support, Apigo participated in the Advisory Board sessions,  the leadership conference and the Nurse Manager Skills Inventory session to facilitate  mentoring. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-11.pdf">(Evidence TL6-11,  CE Certificate from the Leadership Conference)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Running an Effective Meeting</strong><br>
  BGP&rsquo;s nursing retreat, which Stewart  hosts for a full day every December, provides another opportunity for leader  and peer mentoring. In 2016, the retreat included a number of clinical nurses  who function in the charge nurse role. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on goals that Stewart and Apigo  had identified goals, she used the retreat to mentor him in effectively facilitating  a large meeting attended by nurses from multiple clinical roles with varying  needs. At the retreat, Apigo observed Stewart&rsquo;s actions in her leadership role  and how she interacted with nurses from all levels. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-12.pdf">(Evidence TL6-12, Agenda and Attendance Roster from  Leadership Retreat)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Director and CNO One-on-One Meeting and Mentoring</strong><br>
  Stewart meets monthly with each nurse leader  in one-on-one sessions. This structured time is an opportunity for the Nursing  Director to receive coaching and mentorship from the CNO. When a new Director  starts in the role, one of the first items on their competency checklist is a  meeting with Stewart, the CNO, to discuss the Nursing Mission and goals and the  Nursing Strategic Plan. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-13.pdf">(Evidence TL6-13,  Additional Competencies for Nursing Leaders)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who are new to leadership, the  one-on-one meetings are often held weekly or biweekly, instead of monthly, for  the first 90-120 days. Stewart believes this protected one-on-one time is very  important to the development of a skilled nurse leader. For example, Apigo was  promoted from Assistant Nurse Manager (ANM) to Director after one year in that  role. While Apigo is a very good leader, the role of Director brings new challenges  that have required Stewart&rsquo;s mentoring and support. Apigo is open to her  guidance and seeks it regularly in and between these meetings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of Stewart&rsquo;s mentoring of  Apigo comes from late March 2017, when an ANM from the Emergency Center sent an  email to Stewart asking for premium pay for the employees of the department. Premium  pay is a leadership strategy used to incentivize clinical nurses to work extra hours  when the staffing level falls below 70% of required staffing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart met with Apigo on March 30, 2017  to discuss the request for premium pay from an ANM in his department, but he  was unaware of it. Stewart discussed with him the importance of consistent communication  and chain of command, and she coached him on how to address the issue with the  ANM and how to ensure that the information provided was accurate. She also  suggested that Apigo and the ANMs meet with Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BE,  Director of Professional Practice, to discuss staffing and budgeting since he  is the leader who is most knowledgeable about these issues.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-14.pdf">(Evidence TL6-14, Memo to Stewart from ANM and  Memo to Whitney from Apigo)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: Educational Opportunities</strong><br>
  Nurse leaders also have many  opportunities for growth, development and mentorship using the resources made  available to them from outside as well as inside the health system. Each year,  Stewart encourages nurse leaders to attend and actively participate in  leadership conferences.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Stewart&rsquo;s guidance and mentoring, Apigo  has been able to accomplish the following in his short time in the Director  role: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved  patient flow out of the Emergency Center</li>
  <li>Implemented  the Unit Practice Council in the Emergency Center</li>
  <li>Developing  a plan for a Geriatric Emergency Center</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-15.pdf">(Evidence TL6-15 Apigo Evaluation)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Four: Mentoring  for Chief Nursing Officer<u></u></strong><br>
  Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, has been a nurse for over 32 years,  working at the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) location since becoming a  registered nurse. The hospital has come under new executive leadership four times during her career, and  she has been offered new and different opportunities with each change. One of  the most significant changes in her career came when the hospital was acquired  by the Beaumont Health System in 2008, followed by the merger of three hospital  systems to become Beaumont Health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2008, Beaumont Health System acquired  the Grosse Pointe site. Stewart was Nurse Manager of the LDRP unit, and in the  years following the acquisition she was provided nursing leadership education  and growth opportunities that she had not been afforded before. In 2011, Stewart became a  Director of Nursing and was ultimately asked to be the interim CNO when the Vice  President/CNO took a leave of absence in May 2013. The CNO did not return, and  the Vice President/CNO position was posted in February 2014. Stewart applied,  interviewed and was appointed CNO for Beaumont Grosse Pointe in April 2014. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Beaumont Health System merged  with the Oakwood Health System and Botsford Hospital to become Beaumont Health  (BH). This change brought Stewart new and exciting growth and mentoring  opportunities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: System Lead for Staffing and Scheduling</strong><br>
  During the initial transition to  Beaumont Health, Stewart was part of a nursing leadership team, comprising the  CNOs from all eight hospitals, that worked on a variety of transition projects.  Maureen Bowman, MA, BSN, RN,  NEA-BC, interim Beaumont System CNO, and Barbara Medvec, MSN, MSA, RN, NEA-BC,  interim Oakwood System CNO, recommended that Stewart become the CNO sponsor/facilitator for the BH Staffing  and Scheduling team. This team comprised clinical nurse and nurse leader  representatives from the eight hospitals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bowman  and Medvec mentored Stewart during the first few BH meetings. The task of the  Staffing and Scheduling team was to evaluate the current state of staffing and  scheduling programs at all eight sites. The focus was to identify similarities  and differences in staffing and scheduling processes and programs as well as  contingent staff models. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-16.pdf">(Evidence  TL6-16, Minutes for Staffing and Scheduling Taskforce)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: CNO Academy</strong><br>
  When Susan Grant, DNP, RN NEA-BC, FAAN, started  her role as the Executive Vice President and CNO for BH in December 2015,  Stewart&rsquo;s growth and mentoring opportunities  quickly increased as Grant was very attentive to the mentoring needs of her new leadership  team. For example, she provided an opportunity for any of the system CNOs to  attend the CNO Academy sponsored by AMN Healthcare in March 2016 in Chicago,  Illinois. Stewart and three other CNOs from BH attended the conference. This was Stewart&rsquo;s first  opportunity to attend a conference of this caliber and an education offering on  developing the role of the CNO. Another benefit of this gathering was  that it enabled Stewart to spend time and develop relationships with the three  CNOs from the other health systems. This provided additional mentoring  opportunities, as Stewart could now reach out to these CNOs when questions  arose.  Topics covered during the CNO  Academy included &ldquo;CNO, as the  Architect: Designing the Big Picture,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Power of You, Self-Knowledge&rdquo; and  other nursing executive topics.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart was also assigned a personal mentor  from AMN Healthcare, Joyce Batcheller, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN, whom Stewart had  regular contact with during the next 12 months for mentoring in her new role as CNO. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-17.pdf">(Evidence TL6-17, Agenda, CE  Certification for the CNO Academy and Email from Batcheller)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring Activity:  Integration of Beaumont Health</strong><br>
  As the work of this major merger of systems  continued, Grant offered the CNOs many opportunities to be involved in a number  of projects. Stewart&rsquo;s interest in Human Resources proved to be valuable as the  work of pulling together the benefits and compensation programs of three very different  organizations began. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spring 2016, Stewart and her colleague Diane  Hartley, MSN, RN Chief Nursing Officer, Beaumont Wayne, were appointed the CNO  representatives on the benefit work group. Stewart and Hartley attended many  intense sessions of the benefit harmonization team and provided the voice of  nursing in these meetings. In addition to representing nursing, they needed to  bring the discussions back to the BH Nurse Executive Council so their CNO  colleagues knew what was being discussed. Grant had facilitated mentoring  activities for Stewart by placing her on the benefit harmonization team, and she  also arranged mentoring for Stewart from Paul Conway, MBA, Senior Vice  President and Chief Human Resource Officer. Conway helped Stewart gain  knowledge of and exposure to issues related to harmonizing the benefits of the  three founding organizations for the 40,000 employees of Beaumont Health. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefit harmonization committee met  regularly to review and discuss subjects such as medical, pharmacy, vision, disability  and time off programs. Although these three organizations were in the same  market, they had very diverse programs. The team worked with a consultant, Willis, Towers, Watson, on this project, and Stewart  was exposed to many new ways of looking at data, the significance of having the  right data and examining it from many viewpoints.  As  the group reviewed the current state and the harmonized state, it was  clear that the blending of benefits was going to be a significant change for  everyone. Stewart was also included in the Executive Leadership Team meetings  as these benefit decisions were discussed. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-18.pdf">(Evidence TL6-18, PS Collaboration Session May 4, 2016  and Handout)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another opportunity that Grant  encouraged was Stewart&rsquo;s involvement in the Corporate Enterprise Risk  Management Committee, giving Stewart exposure to an area in which she had no prior  experience. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee was formed to identify any  potential risks to the corporation such as internal or external risks to the  electronic medical record. Grant suggested to Stewart during one of their  conversations that this committee would give her an opportunity to expand her  knowledge base of issues outside nursing.     </p>

<p><strong>Mentoring  Activity: CNO One-on-One with System CNO</strong> <br>
  Stewart also engages in monthly one-on-one  meetings with Grant in which she updates Grant on the status of nursing at BGP  and seeks Grant&rsquo;s opinions and guidance. As Grant is the first system CNO whom Stewart  has worked with, this time has been invaluable. The challenges at BGP are often  not unique, and Grant readily offers her experiences, advice and support to  Stewart as a mentor. Based on their one-on-one meetings, Grant believed Stewart  would be an appropriate speaker for the national conference of the Institute  for Patient- and Family-Centered Care (IPFCC). One of the speakers could not  attend because of an emergency, so Grant suggested to Beverley Johnson,  President and CEO for IPFCC, that Stewart would be a great replacement. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-19.pdf">(Evidence TL6-19, Calendar of  Stewart and Grant&rsquo;s Appointment, and Memo Regarding Presentation Opportunity)</a></p>

<p>Another mentoring opportunity that Grant  offered Stewart was involvement in a second-level review of an incident that  occurred at another BH hospital. The CNO and Hospital President of that  facility could not agree on the outcome of a significant situation involving a  nurse and a patient. There had been many meetings between the CNO, Hospital  President, Human Resources and the  legal department on the case, and as they were at a standstill the case  was escalated to Grant. Instead of providing her opinion, Grant asked that the  group get together and include her and another neutral CNO to discuss this  matter. Grant asked Stewart to be the CNO representative.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 31, 2016, the team met and  discussed the case. Present at the meeting were the CNO from BH Hospital-A, the  President from BH Hospital-A, Grant and Stewart, who was the neutral CNO. The  goal was to have two parties (Grant and Stewart) who were not involved in the  incident review the data and render an opinion. This was the first second-level  review by the System CNO and another CNO done at BH. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the BH merger, Stewart approached  Grant about the future of the Staffing and Scheduling committee, of which  Stewart had been the CNO sponsor. The committee was on hold due to competing  priorities. Grant asked Stewart to not only continue as the CNO sponsor for the  team, but to be the single source for the Staffing and Scheduling vendor, McKesson.  Per Grant&rsquo;s request, McKesson includes Stewart in all communications with any  of the BH hospitals. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL6-20.pdf">(Evidence  TL6-20, Calendar and Email regarding Case; September 19, 16 Email from Grant  regarding McKesson)</a></p>

<p>Stewart continues to develop in her role  of CNO of BGP, supported by the mentoring opportunities provided by Grant and  Beaumont Health.</p>
