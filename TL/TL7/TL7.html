<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3 Southeast Nurse Leaders Using Trended  Turnover Data to Support the Decision to Hire a Team Leader</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2014, 3 Southeast (3SE) Orthopedic  Unit Assistant Nurse Managers (ANM) Alexis Rogers, RN and Mandy O&rsquo;Toole, RN,  reported directly to Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and  Chief Nursing Officer. Rogers and O&rsquo;Toole held authority for 3SE, a 44-bed Medical  and Surgical Unit that specializes in the care of adult orthopedic  patients.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2014, the orthopedic volume was up  10% from 2013; however, the length of stay (LOS) decreased from 4.03 to 3.55  days. The average daily census (ADC) in 2014 was 19 patients per day. Stewart  suggested that, although the volume was increasing, the LOS was decreasing so  the ADC was also decreasing. It was decided that 3SE&rsquo;s ADC did not support two ANM  positions, so in March 2015 the off shift ANM position was eliminated.<strong> </strong>Rogers was selected for the 3SE ANM  role because of her expertise and managerial experience, but O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s  departure left a void in direct leadership support for the off shift staff.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical  Nurse Input </strong><br>
  In late March 2015, after O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s departure,3SE clinical nurses Patricia Danna, RN;  Lori Leman, BSN, RN; and Sara Munsterman, BSN, RN requested a meeting with Rogers  to express their concern that O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s departure had left a lack of leadership  and clinical expertise on the off shift. They  told Rogers that new clinical nurse hires for off shift positions are typically  graduate or novice RNs, and that charge nurse responsibilities on the off shift  fell to clinical nurses without the ANM. The off shift clinical nurse carried  the charge phone, managed patient flow within the unit, created the staffing  assignment for the on-coming shift, assigned surgical beds and acted as a  resource to the staff, all while managing a patient assignment. Leman said that an excess of novice  nurses on the midnight shift increased the burden on the experienced nurses. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-1.pdf">(Evidence TL7-1, Notes from March  30, 2015 Meeting)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To gain more insight into the issues, in April  2015 Rogers conducted informal exit interviews with clinical nurses Charlette  Benson, RN and Jameson Thompson, RN, who were leaving 3SE. The nurses  identified the following themes in these exit interviews: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Carrying  the 3SE charge phone with a full patient assignment is stressful. </li>
  <li>Carrying  the 3SE charge phone with a full patient assignment interrupts patient care.</li>
  <li>The  shift was lacking a mentor.</li>
  <li>The  shit was lacking an experienced clinical nurse as a &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; person.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trended Data</strong><br>
  In late March 2015, Danna, Leman and Munsterman  met with Rogers to discuss their concerns and  determine the unit&rsquo;s needs. Over the next few months, clinical nurse turnover  on the unit continued. In July 2015, Rogers reviewed 3SE&rsquo;s clinical nurse  turnover and transfer trended data for April, May and June 2015. Beaumont  Health defines&ldquo;turnover&rdquo;  as someone who has left the corporation, and &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; as someone who has left  their current unit. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-2.pdf">(Evidence  TL7-2, 3SE Clinical Nurse Turnover Trended Data)</a>  </p>

<p>To further understand the issues and the  nursing staff&rsquo;s concerns, Rogers reviewed LOS trended data for 3SE, which  demonstrated that the average LOS was decreasing. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-3.pdf">(Evidence TL7-3, 3SE Length of Stay Trended Data)</a> Rogers  knew that while the LOS had decreased, the throughput had increased. She  recognized that with patients moving through the system more quickly, less experienced  nurses can easily become overwhelmed with the required work. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After seeking input from the clinical  nurses and reviewing the data, Rogers recognized that something needed to be  done to create a positive, safe and supportive environment for off shift clinical  nurses. During one of Rogers&rsquo; one-on-one meetings with Stewart, Rogers discussed  the clinical nurses&rsquo; concerns about the lack of leadership on the off shift. Stewart suggested to Rogers that she meet with  the clinical nurses and develop a plan to address their concerns and decrease  the clinical nurse turnover rate on 3SE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers recalled that in late 2013 the  Critical Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU) had experienced a high clinical nurse turnover  and had a large influx of new graduate nurses on the off shift. To support the midnight shift clinical nurses, CCSU successfully  implemented the Team Leader role. Rogers thought this might be exactly what the  3SE off shift needed. She therefore met with CCSU  Assistant Nurse Managers Susan Wolka, BSN, RN and  Eric Quenneville, BSN, RN to inquire about the success of the off shift Team  Leader role on CCSU. Wolka and Quenneville gave Rogers a copy of the Team Leader  job description and suggestions on how to proceed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3SE had 20.85 budgeted full-time  equivalents (FTEs) for clinical nurses. Of these, 10.42 FTEs were clinical  nurses for the off shift. Rogers reached out to Dana Ludwig, Employment  Representative Human Resource Grosse Pointe, for a list of the RNs hired to 3SE  in 2015. The list showed that 53% of the RNs on the 3SE off shift had little to  no nursing experience.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers began to develop her plan to address the  turnover on 3SE. To further validate her proposal, in November 2015 she met  with clinical nurses hired for the off shift in 2014 and 2015. Rogers asked about  the 3SE onboarding experience and opportunities for improvement. Feedback from  the nurses included the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The  experienced staff members were too busy to answer questions.  </li>
  <li>While  orienting a new nurse, the preceptor often had to manage a patient care  assignment and also carry the charge phone at times. </li>
  <li>The  midnight shift nurses felt unsupported.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request for Additional  Resources: Lead Position and Budgeted Dollars</strong><br>
  In November 2015, Rogers used the trended data,  the information obtained from Wolka and Quenneville, and the information obtained  from the discussions with the clinical nurses to develop a proposal to present  to Stewart.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers highlighted the increased clinical nurse  turnover, the large number of inexperienced nurses on the off shift and comments from the clinical nurse survey.   Rogers  proposed to Stewart that a Team Leader position be created for 3SE for the off  shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main duties of the team leader would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To  collaborate with the ANM on clinical and non-clinical issues</li>
  <li>To  be responsible for the direct oversight and supervision of the off shift staff</li>
  <li>To  provide resources, guidance and training to the new clinical nurses</li>
  <li>To  promote and support a positive working relationship and effective teambuilding </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Resources  Acquired</strong><br>
  Stewart was supportive of Rogers&rsquo;  request. To acquire the resources needed to create this position, Rogers  converted one clinical nurse FTE to a Team Leader position with additional  budgeted dollars allocated for this position. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-4.pdf">(Evidence TL7-4, Form 525 #6697  Adding Team Leader Position, job posting on unit and new hire letter from Humarn Resources)</a> Rogers used the CCSU Team Leader job  description and customized it to meet the needs of the 3SE unit. The Team Leader  position was posted internally on December 2, 2015 in the 3SE staff conference  room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2016, clinical nurse Julie  Lynch, BSN, RN was hired into the role of Team Leader for 3 Southeast. Lynch was  familiar with 3SE&rsquo;s culture and practices because of her previous tenure on the  unit, making her a great fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supporting  the Care Delivery System</strong><br>
  Rogers analyzed trended data and acquired  the necessary resources to support the 3SE patient  care delivery system. By stabilizing the staffing on the off shift and having more experienced nurses on the unit,  patient outcomes and experience began to improve. One example is falls with injuries:  In third quarter 2015, the rate of falls with injury was 0.57 per 1,000 patient  days. This decreased to 0.0 in second quarter 2016, 0.49 in third quarter 2016  and 0.0 in fourth quarter 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynch successfully improved  the morale on 3SE and onboarded 10 newly hired clinical nurses. Ensuring that the  clinical nurse positions are filled has improved the care delivery system. The  presence of a Team Leader on the off shift has also unified the clinical nurses,  and there was zero turnover from July 2016 to November 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-5.pdf">(Evidence TL7-5, July 2016 to  November 2016 Grosse Pointe Nursing Unit  Turnover)</a></p>
