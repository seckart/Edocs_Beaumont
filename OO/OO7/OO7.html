<h2>Organizational Overview 7</h2>
<h2>Structural Empowerment </h2>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>An action plan that includes a target and  demonstrates evidence of progress toward 80% of registered nurses obtaining a  baccalaureate or graduate degree in nursing by 2020. Include an assessment of  the current status; an evaluation of methods and strategies to increase the  educational level of the workforce; and an appraisal of established, realistic  targets to meet the organization's strategy to increase the number of  registered nurses with a degree in nursing (baccalaureate or graduate degree).</em></p>
<H4>&nbsp;</H4>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Action Plan Target</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>80% of Beaumont  Gross Pointe (BGP) registered nurses at all levels will  have at least a baccalaureate (BSN) or graduate (MSN) degree in nursing by  2020. This includes clinical nurses, coordinators/supervisors, clinical nurse  specialists/APRNs, directors/managers, executives and the CNO. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of the Current Status</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Status of Progress Toward 80% of Nurses with a BSN  or Higher Degree </strong> <br>
  Data on education  level is collected either quarterly or annually in October to determine the  percent of registered nurses at all levels who have a BSN or higher nursing  degree.  The data for the following areas  is collected quarterly and reported to NDNQI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In-Patient  Nursing</li>
  <li>Surgical  Services </li>
  <li>Emergency  Center</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other  areas/services report the data annually to Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director  of Professional Practice and MPD. The data is distributed quarterly to the CNO,  directors and administrative managers and is then shared with the unit staffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP is  committed to nurses&rsquo; ongoing education and development. Nursing leadership set  a goal to increase nurses at all levels with a BSN or higher degree by 4-10%  each year. The wide variability in the goal is due to programs put in place by  BGP and Beaumont Health, as the anticipated benefit of the new and enhanced  tuition reimbursement will not be evident until 2019 and 2020. The goal set by  nursing leadership for 2017 is 60% of nurses with a BSN or higher, with 80% of nurses  holding a BSN or higher by 2020. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Methods and Strategies </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Preferred Hiring of Candidates with a  BSN</strong><br>
  The Human  Resources Department recruiters and administrative managers (AM) give  preference to the applications of BSN-prepared candidates in the hiring  process. AMs interview BSN-prepared nurses before nurses without a BSN. In 2015,  BGP hired approximately 90 clinical nurses, 40-50% of whom were new graduates.  The strategy to give preference to hiring nurses with a BSN will contribute to  BGP achieving its 2017 goal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The hiring of BSN and non-BSN nurses by  unit, compiled from new hire data, is reviewed quarterly by hospital and nursing  leadership.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Preferred Hiring of Canadian Nurses</strong><br>
  BGP is  located approximately 20 minutes from Windsor, Ontario Canada. Most Canadian  nurses hired who have attended school in Canada within the last 10 years are bachelor&rsquo;s-prepared,  as the entry level for nurses in Ontario since 2005 has been a BSN. BGP attends  numerous job fairs in Windsor, Ontario to recruit and hire BSN-prepared nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: BSN nurses hired from Canada, compiled  from new hire data, is reviewed quarterly by nursing leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Professional Ladder Advancement  Policy</strong><br>
  The  Professional Ladder advancement policy permits and encourages RNs whose primary  role is to provide direct patient care to advance in clinical practice and  receive recognition and compensation for their achievement and expertise. Clinical  nurses receive points that may be claimed annually for credit toward  Professional Ladder advancement. To become a Clinical Nurse IV, a minimum of a BSN  degree is required.  <br>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/OO5-11.pdf">(Evidence OO5-11, Policy 245 Professional  Ladder Program)</a> <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/OO5-12.pdf"> (Evidence OO5-12, Policy 853 Professional Ladder Program)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The number of clinical nurses who have  a BSN and are on the Professional Ladder, compiled by Nursing Education, is  reviewed annually by nursing leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Degree Requirements </strong><br>
  BGP sets  expectations for formal nursing education by requiring certain degrees for  specific job categories since June 2015. For  example, a minimum of a BSN is required for many job categories in the  organization, including chief nursing officer, director of nursing, administrative  manager, associate nurse manager, clinical nurse specialist, educational  specialist, care manager and nurse researcher. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation: </strong>The hiring of positions is monitored  continually by Human Resources. Candidates who do not have at least a BSN are  not eligible for hire/advancement. All nurses in these job categories hold at  least a BSN. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Enhanced Tuition Reimbursement for Nurses  with a Diploma or Associate Degree to Obtain a BSN Degree</strong><br>
  BGP  nurses are benefiting from a new tuition reimbursement program to complete  their BSN degree. As Beaumont Health supports the goal of 80% of nurses holding  a BSN by 2020, it offers expanded tuition reimbursement for employees  completing an RN to BSN degree. The new program, in place since December 2016  and available to both full- and part-time nurses, pays up to 70% of the average  cost of a credit hour in Michigan (eight credits for full-time and four credits  for part-time) per semester or quarter. As of January 2017, eight clinical  nurses are enrolled in the program. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/OO7-1.pdf">(Evidence OO7-1, Tuition  Reimbursement: RN to BSN Degree Completion) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  addition to the Enhanced Tuition Reimbursement program, the program providing $3,000  annually for education expenses is still available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Annual expenditures for tuition  reimbursement are increasing. This will include the number of clinical nurses  enrolled in the program, the cost of the Enhanced Tuition Reimbursement and the  percentage of BSN-prepared nurses. The dollars are budgeted at the corporate  level.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: Nursing Scholarships</strong><br>
  Nurses  receive scholarships to assist with continuing education expenses. Three  nursing scholarships were distributed at BGP in 2016, two for undergraduate  degrees and one for a graduate degree. The Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe  Assistance League distributed $15,000 to undergraduate nursing students who  were diploma or associate degree-prepared, as well as to entry level nursing  students. The Francys D. Marco Scholarship distributed $6,000 to undergraduate  nursing students who were diploma or associate degree-prepared, as well as to  entry level nursing students. The Audrey N. Kottenstette scholarship distributed  $750 to graduate nursing students who were employed as nurses at BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The number and amount of scholarships  given annually is determined by the interest on the endowments of each  scholarship. Whitney and Nancy Jones, Manager, Gift Shop and Assistance League,  are the hospital representatives who meet with representatives from the  Assistance League and the Marco and Kottenstette families to assist in determining  scholarship recipients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Appraisal of Established, Realistic Targets</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal to Achieve 80% of RNs with BSN or Higher  by 2020</strong><br>
  The goal  to achieve 80% of nurses at all levels with a BSN is outlined in the graph  below. The goal is to have 60% of all nurses at BGP hold at least a BSN degree  in 2017, 65% in 2018, 70% in 2019 and 80% in 2020. BGP set this as a hospital-wide  goal, and it is listed in the Employee Engagement sections of the Beaumont  Grosse Pointe 2017 Objectives Monthly Strategic Tracker. With the programs currently  in place and the importance of the hospital goal, full achievement of this target  is expected.<br>
