  Organizational Overview 17</h2>
<h2>Exemplary Professional Practice </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A  description of the infrastructure, the organizational committees, and the  decision-making bodies specifically designed to oversee the quality of patient  care. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beaumont Health Board of Directors</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board of Directors for Beaumont Health  assumes ultimate responsibility for the quality, safety and appropriateness of  patient care provided. They have established and authorized a plan to provide  the structure for performance improvement and patient safety.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board recognizes performance improvement  and patient safety to be an ongoing high priority for the health system. They  have endorsed the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s definition of quality: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Quality is the extent  to which health services for individuals and populations increase the  likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current  professional knowledge.&rdquo;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve this, a formal structure was developed  to examine the care provided. This provides an opportunity to evaluate, monitor  and improve the quality, safety and appropriateness of the care provided. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/OO17-1.pdf">(Evidence OO17-1, Beaumont Grosse  Pointe Hospital Quality and Safety Communication Structure)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality and Safety  Committee of the Board</strong><br>
  The Board of Directors receives information  from the Quality and Safety Committee of the Board (BQSC), which is a  subcommittee of the Board. The BQSC provides strategic guidance and  coordination of all quality and safety activities for the system. The data  shared with the Board encompasses both internal and external quality and safety  measures. The internal measures are sentinel event recommendations and the  quality matrix, and the external measures include core measure and pay for  performance scores and other publically reported measures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Quality and  Safety Leadership Team</strong><br>
  The Quality and Safety Leadership Team (QSLT),  a corporate committee, meets every month and reviews the system&rsquo;s quality and  safety data. It looks at core measure data, National Database of Nursing  Quality Indicators (NDNQI), quality matrix data, sentinel event summary and  patient satisfaction scores. Hospital-specific data for these areas presented  on a rotating basis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the QSLT include corporate quality  leadership and members from each hospital. Participants from Beaumont Grosse  Pointe (BGP) include the Director of Quality and Patient Safety, Patient Safety  Officer, Hospital Vice President of Operations, Hospital Chief Nursing Officer  and Hospital President.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beaumont Grosse Pointe  Quality and Safety Council</strong><br>
  At the hospital level, the Quality Safety  Council (QSC) meets monthly to review BGP-specific data and issues. Members  include:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Director  of Quality, Safety and Epidemiology Department</li>
  <li>Medical  Chief of Quality and Safety and Patient Safety Officer</li>
  <li>Hospital  President</li>
  <li>Physician-in-Chief</li>
  <li>Chief  Nursing Officer </li>
  <li>Vice  President of Operations</li>
  <li>Chief  of Medicine</li>
  <li>Administrative  Directors</li>
  <li>Legal  Affairs</li>
  <li>Directors  of Nursing</li>
  <li>Administrative  Managers </li>
  <li>Nursing  Leadership</li>
  <li>System  Quality and Safety Chief</li>
  <li>Vice  Presidents and Directors of Quality and Patient Safety</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each  month, different departments present their quality matrix scores and action  plans and the results of their culture of safety survey, which is a survey  completed by direct patient care staff to measure their perception of safety.  Action plans are formulated at the direct care personnel level, with leadership  involvement, and are shared and reviewed at the Quality and Safety Council  meetings.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every  clinical department participates, and the focus is to identify areas for  improvement in the hospital&rsquo;s culture to make the environment safer for the  patients and staff. It is encouraging for the staff to see these efforts and the  attention paid to identified issues or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the monthly QSC meeting, there  is a weekly rotation of Quality and Safety Teams. The rotating teams consist of  nurses, process owners and nurse leaders from each clinical area, including  Emergency Center, Trauma, Stroke Team, Critical Care, Medical/Surgical units,  Mother Baby Unit, Surgical Service, Heart and Vascular, and Bariatric. The core  group includes the Director for Quality and Safety, CNO, VP of Operations and  Hospital President. The purpose of the weekly meeting is to address individual  service area performance measures and barriers to performance, and to ensure  actual process owners are engaged in the performance improvement efforts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional monthly agenda items include the  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sentinel  and high priority cases are reviewed, and the recommendations are approved or  modified.  </li>
  <li>NDNQI  data are included in the matrix report. Areas not meeting target are presented,  and associated action plans are reviewed and discussed. </li>
  <li>The  Infection Prevention Committee presents each month. It reports out previous meeting  topics, areas of concern and any action plans related to hospital-wide  infection prevention action plans, such as overall hand hygiene, MRSA lab  events, etc.  </li>
  <li>The  Medical Executive Committee (MEC) updates are reported by the Patient Safety  Officer. Updates include concerns from previous meetings and any significant  changes made at the MEC. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Quality and Safety Department nurses (Susan  Muscat, BSN, RN, Director of Quality and Safety; Kelly Benoit, BSN, RN, Quality  Nurse; and Lorraine Innes, RN, Quality Nurse) are involved in every aspect of  quality of patient care. The quality nurses are champions for root cause  analyses, sentinel and high priority reviews, and failure mode and effects analyses,  as well as quality reviews and peer review for medical staff.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality Information Disseminated  to the Clinical Nurses </strong><br>
  The Quality and Safety department reports  directly to Vice President of Operations Kristen Cavender, MBA, BSIE, CSSBB,  and has a dotted line to Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and  Chief Nursing Officer. Cavender and Stewart attend the monthly QSC meetings and  the MEC. Quality and Safety is also represented on the Professional Nurse Council  (PNC) as a voting member. Benoit is the PNC Quality Department representative. Benoit  and Muscat both present quality metrics and updates to the PNC on quality events,  trends, recommendations and follow-up.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PNC is made up of clinical nurses. After  they get information at the PNC, they take this back to their unit practice  councils to the keep the rest of the clinical nurses informed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality and Safety  Rounding</strong><br>
  Another way in which nursing and medical  leadership demonstrate the commitment to safety and quality is through patient  safety rounds, which are conducted monthly. The rounding team consists of the  CNO, Patient Safety Officer, Quality and Safety Director, and a Board member. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient safety rounding team visits clinical  areas and engages the staff in discussing what they deem to be safety concerns.  These concerns are obstacles they encounter when trying to provide safe,  quality and appropriate care to patients. While it is usually the nurses and  nursing assistants who are interviewed during these rounds, anyone on the unit,  including physicians, may be interviewed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the mechanisms for process improvement  in patient care is the multidisciplinary team approach used for serious safety  events, sentinel events or high priority reviews. The root cause analysis  methodology is used to determine system failures and identify resolutions. Serious  quality or safety events are identified through a number of venues.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Quality and  Safety Issues</strong><br>
  The most common method for identifying quality  or safety concerns is through the electronic safety event reporting system, RL.  Event reporting can be anonymous if the person making the report so chooses.  The Patient Safety Nurse reviews and investigates every safety event report,  doing so daily, and communicates these to nursing leaders and department  leaders during the daily face to face operations meetings. Process owners work  with department managers to identify and implement &ldquo;quick fixes&rdquo; or &ldquo;gap actions&rdquo;  to address process or procedure failures. Feedback is given to the department  manager to share with staff members as appropriate. The shared feedback helps  staff members understand the value and positive improvement in patient safety  and quality of care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some events are beyond the quick fix and  require the full multidisciplinary team approach, which generates the process  for a root cause analysis. This is determined by Muscat and the Medical Chief  of Quality and Safety. Actions taken to report and improve patient safety are  recognized monthly with Eagle Eye awards and Good Catch recognition. The awards  are presented during the monthly QSC meeting.  </p>
